Ostensible,[ah-STEN-si-bul],"Apparent, appearing or seeming to be true, professed or declared as true without being demonstrated or proved.<br>More difficult synonyms of ostensible include plausible (PLAW-zi-bul) and specious (SPEE-shus). Specious, however, has the negative suggestion of using deception to make something false appear true. A specious argument is one that looks good on the surface but is flawed underneath.<br>Ostensible is often used in opposition to real or actual. An ostensible motive is not necessarily a real motive; an ostensible advantage is not necessarily an actual advantage. Ostensible means apparent, stated as true but not necessarily proved.<br><br>Apparent, appearing or seeming to be true, professed or declared as true without being demonstrated or proved.<br>Synonyms: plausible, specious."
Digress,[di-GRES or dy-GRES],"To wander, stray from the point, ramble, deviate, go off in another direction.<br>Digress comes from the Latin digressus, which comes in turn from the prefix dis-, apart, and gradi, to go, walk, step. Digress means literally to go apart, walk away. From the same Latin source come ingress (IN-gres), the place you walk in, the entrance; and egress (EE-gres), the place you walk out, the exit.<br>Digress once was used of a physical wandering or turning aside, but that sense is now archaic (ahr-KAY-ik), which means old-fashioned. Today we do not say, ""She turned right and digressed down Main Street."" Instead, digress is used of speaking or writing that departs from the main point or subject at hand and wanders off in another direction: ""In a business report or an oral presentation, it's important to stick to the facts and not digress""; ""If she hadn't digressed so much, her lecture would have been more interesting.""<br>The corresponding noun is digression (di-GRESH-un or dy-GRESH-un):<br>""The old man's story was full of humorous digressions.""<br><br>To wander, stray from the point, ramble, deviate, go off in another direction.<br>Corresponding noun: digression.<br>Related words: ingress, the place you walk in, the entrance; egress, the place you walk out, the exit.<br>Additional useful word: archaic (ar-KAY-ik), old-fashioned."

Misanthropy (mis-AN-thruh-pee) is hatred of humankind, a spiteful or pessimistic attitude about the human race.

Adept,[uh-DEPT],"Skilled.<br>Synonyms include handy, clever, able, deft, expert, adroit, dexterous (DEK-strus, also DEK-stur-us), and proficient (pruh-FISH-int, not proh-).<br>Adept comes from the Latin adeptus, an alchemist who has learned how to do the impossible—change base metals into gold.

A person or a thing that is capricious is subject to caprices—to abrupt, unpredictable changes: ""He's so capricious, his mood changes with the wind""; ""New England has a capricious climate""; ""The stock market is notoriously capricious.""<br>Did you notice that my recommended pronunciation for capricious is kuh-PRISH-us, the second syllable rhyming with wish? You will hear educated speakers say kuh-PREE-shus, a pronunciation based on the corresponding noun caprice (kuh-PREES). This variant has been recognized by American dictionaries since the 1960s. But authorities have preferred kuh-PRISH-us since the 18th century, when pronunciation was first recorded. Current American dictionaries list kuh-PRISH-us first, and it is the only pronunciation in the Oxford English Dictionary.

Adamant,[AD-uh-mint],"Unyielding, immovable, inflexible, refusing to give in, unshakable, unrelenting, implacable. ""She was adamant in her opposition to the plan.""<br>The adjective adamant comes from the noun adamant, which refers to a hard substance or stone, such as a diamond, that in ancient times was believed to be unbreakable.

Concur,[kun-KUR],"To agree, be in accord with, unite in opinion.<br>Concur comes from the Latin con-, together, and currere, to run, flow, and means literally to run or flow together, go along with.
