One meaning of the verb to provide is to prepare for some anticipated condition in the future, as to provide for a rainy day.

Impute,[im-PYOOT],"To charge or attribute, especially with a fault or misconduct, lay the responsibility or blame upon, ascribe, assign.<br>Unlike the verb to credit, which has a favorable connotation, and the verbs to assign and to ascribe (uh-SKRYB), which are neutral, the verb to impute often has a negative connotation. According to the famous eighteenth-century essayist and lexicographer Samuel Johnson, ""We usually ascribe good, but impute evil."" (Do you need to look up lexicographer?)<br>To impute means to charge with something bad, attribute the blame for, lay the responsibility on: ""They imputed their fourth-quarter losses to sagging sales and fluctuations in the stock market""; ""Some critics impute the decline in verbal skills among young people today to watching too much television.""<br>The corresponding noun is imputation, a charge or accusation, the act of imputing, as ""Company officials vigorously denied the imputation of mismanagement.""<br><br>To charge or attribute, especially with a fault or misconduct, lay the responsibility or blame upon, ascribe, assign.<br>Usage tip: The verb to credit has a favorable connotation.

Neophyte,"[NEE-uh-fyt, like knee a fight]","A beginner, novice, amateur, tyro; specifically, a new member of or convert to a religion.<br>There are several interesting words for various types of inexperienced persons.<br>Tyro (TY-roh) comes from a Latin word meaning a recruit in the Roman army, a newly enlisted soldier. Tyro is used today to mean a raw beginner, one who may be eager to learn but who is utterly incompetent.<br>Amateur (AM-uh-tur or -chur) comes from the Latin amare, to love. By derivation an amateur is a person who does something for the love of it rather than for money. An amateur may or may not be skilled, but the word often implies a lower level of competence than expert or professional.<br>A dilettante (DIL-uh-TAHNT or DIL-uh-TAHNT) is an amateur practitioner of an art, such as music, painting, acting, dancing, or literary composition. Dilettante is often used disparagingly of someone who dabbles in something and lacks the serious discipline necessary to excel.<br>Like tyro, both novice and neophyte refer to a person just starting out at something. Tyro emphasizes the beginner's incompetence; novice emphasizes the beginner's inexperience; and neophyte emphasizes the beginner's enthusiasm.<br><br>A beginner, novice, amateur, tyro; specifically, a new member of or convert to a religion.<br>N.B.

Credence,[KREE-dints],"Belief, acceptance, especially belief in a published report or acceptance of another's opinion or testimony: ""In recent years many medical studies have shown that reducing fat intake can help prevent heart disease, and there is now widespread credence among the public that a low-fat diet is more healthful.""<br>Credence, creed, credible, and credulous all come from the Latin credere, to believe. Credible means believable, and credulous means willing to believe without questioning. Creed, word 21 of Level 1, refers to a declared belief or formal set of opinions: ""Conservatism is his creed."" Credence refers to belief itself, to acceptance of something stated or heard: ""It is dangerous to give credence to gossip.""<br>Credence is often used with the verbs to give or lend.

Venerate,[VEN-uh-rayt],"To respect deeply, revere, regard with awe and adoration.<br>In a strict sense, to venerate means to regard as holy or sacred; to revere means to regard with great respect and honor. We revere great leaders, thinkers, and artists; we venerate holy persons, sacred writings, and religious or moral principles.<br>The adjective venerable, worthy of veneration, of being venerated, is more loosely applied.

Venerable is often used of something or someone old or long-established."
Garrulous,[GAR-uh-lus],"Talkative, especially in a rambling, annoying, pointless, or long-winded way.<br>Garrulous comes from the Latin garrire, to chatter, babble, talk in a rambling and tiresome way. In zoology (properly pronounced zoh-AHL-uh-jee, not zoo-) there is a genus of birds called Garrulus. This genus contains several of the common jays, which are known for their harsh, chattering call. Both by derivation and by association, garrulous means chattering like a jaybird. The garrulous person talks for the sake of talking, usually about trivial matters, and often babbles on when no one else is interested in listening.<br>Synonyms of garrulous include verbose (word 30 of Level 2), loquacious, voluble (word 1 of Level 5), and prolix (word 1 of Level 9). Antonyms of garrulous include reserved, reticent, taciturn (word 2 of Level 3), and laconic (word 18 of Level 3).<br><br>Talkative, especially in a rambling, annoying, pointless, or long-winded way.<br>Synonyms: verbose (Level 2, Word 30), loquacious, voluble (Level 5, Word 1), and prolix (Level 9, Word 1).<br>Antonyms: reserved, reticent, taciturn (Level 3, Word 2), laconic (Level 3, Word 18).<br>Etymology: Garrulous comes from the Latin garrire, to chatter, babble, talk in a rambling and tiresome way (literally, ""to chatter like a jaybird"")."
Trenchant,[TREN-chint],"Keen, penetrating, vigorously effective, sharp and to the point.<br>Synonyms of trenchant include forceful, acute, and incisive.<br>Incisive (in-SY-siv) applies to expression that gets right to the point or penetrates the heart of the matter. Cutting and biting imply harsh or sarcastic expression that hurts the feelings. Trenchant, which comes from a French verb meaning to cut, suggests both the forcefulness of incisive and the sharp, painful implication of cutting and biting.<br>A trenchant analysis is keen and vigorous; a trenchant style is sharp and clear; a trenchant remark displays penetrating insight and has the ability to wound.<br><br>Keen, penetrating, vigorously effective, sharp and to the point.<br>Synonyms: forceful, acute, incisive."
Autonomous,[aw-TAHN-uh-mus],"Independent, self-governing, not under the control of something or someone else.<br>Autonomous comes from the Greek autos, self, and nomos, law, and means literally self-ruling. From the Greek autos, self, comes the English combining form auto-, which also means self. Auto- appears in many English words, including autobiography, a story of oneself, of one's own life; autograph, one's own signature; automobile, literally a self-moving vehicle; automatic, literally self-thinking, done without conscious thought; and autocracy (aw-TAHK-ruh-see), not self-government but rule by one self or one person—hence, dictatorship, tyranny, despotism (DES-puh-tiz-'m).<br>The corresponding noun autonomy (aw-TAHN-uh-mee) means self-government, independence.<br>The heart is an autonomous organ; it functions by itself. An autonomous company is independent, not a subsidiary (suhb-SID-ee-ER-ee—five syllables, not four) of another corporation. When the United States won its independence from Great Britain, it became an autonomous nation.<br>Independent, self-governing, not under the control of something or someone else.<br>Etymology and related words: The Greek autos, self, is the source of the English combining form auto-, self, which appears in many words, including autobiography, autograph, automobile, automatic, and autocracy, rule by one self or one personhence, dictatorship, tyranny, despotism."
Panacea,[PAN-uh-SEE-uh],"A cure-all, universal antidote, remedy for all diseases and difficulties.<br>Panacea comes from the Greek pan-, all, and akos, cure, and today retains its literal meaning, cure-all. From the same Greek pan-, all, comes the English prefix pan-, which appears in front of a number of English words: a panorama (PAN-uh-RAM-uh) is literally a view all around; pantheism (PAN-thee-iz-'m), from the Greek theos, god, is the belief that all things are God, that God is universal; and a pantheon (PAN-thee-un or<br>-on) is a temple dedicated to all the gods, or all the gods worshiped by a given people. In current usage pantheon may also mean any group of highly respected or revered persons. When novelist Toni Morrison won a Nobel Prize in 1993, she earned a place beside such esteemed writers as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, and Mark Twain in the pantheon of American literature.<br>You have probably heard the common phrase ""a panacea for all ills."" The expression is redundant, because panacea by itself means a cure for all ills, a universal remedy. You may use panacea to mean either a cure-all for physical ailments or an antidote for worldly woes: ""His lawyer emphasized that filing for bankruptcy would not be a panacea for his financial troubles.""<br><br>A cure-all, universal antidote, remedy for all diseases and difficulties.<br>Etymology and related words: The English prefix pan- (from Greek), means ""all."" This prefix appears in front of a number of useful English words, including panorama, pantheism, and pantheon.<br>Usage tip: The common expression ""a panacea for all ills"" is redundant. Panacea by itself means a cure for all ills, a universal remedy."
Ephemeral,[i-FEM-uh-rul],"Short-lived, passing, fleeting, lasting for a short time. (By the way, did you remember that short-lived should rhyme with strived? If you've forgotten why this pronunciation is preferred, see transient, word 31 of Level 2.)<br>Ephemeral comes from a Greek word meaning daily, lasting or living only for a day. Ephemeral is sometimes used in this literal sense, as in the phrase ""ephemeral literature,"" publications that come out every day, such as newspapers. Ephemeral literature is opposed to periodical literature, which refers to anything published periodically—weekly, monthly, and so on. In fact, the familiar word journalism by derivation means ephemeral literature, writing that pertains to the events of the day. Journalism and journal come from the French jour, day, as in the restaurant menu item soup du jour, soup of the day. Thus the common expression ""daily journal"" is redundant, for by derivation journal means something written or published each day.<br>Today ephemeral is most often used in a general sense to mean conspicuously brief in duration. Ephemeral ideas are popular for only a brief while; the jokes of late-night TV comedians are ephemeral, here today and gone tomorrow; an ephemeral trend in the economy or in fashion is one that passes swiftly away.<br>More difficult synonyms of ephemeral include transitory (word 4 of Level 5), evanescent, fugitive, and fugacious (word 24 of Level 9). For more on these words, review the discussion of transient, word 31 of Level 2.<br><br>Short-lived, passing, fleeting, lasting for a short time.<br>Synonyms: transitory, evanescent, fugitive, fugacious. For more on these words, review the discussion of transient (Level 2, Word 31).<br>Usage tip: The common expression ""daily journal"" is redundant, for by derivation journal (from the French jour, day) means something written or published each day."
Onerous,"[AHN-ur-us, like honor us]","Burdensome, troublesome, oppressive, hard to bear, difficult to accomplish or endure: an onerous task, an onerous assignment.<br>Onerous comes from the Latin onus, a load, burden. Directly from the Latin comes the English word onus (OH-nus), a burden, obligation, especially a disagreeable responsibility. Onerous means like an onus, and therefore burdensome, troublesome, difficult to accomplish or endure. <br>Burdensome, troublesome, oppressive, hard to bear, difficult to accomplish or endure.<br>Related word: onus (OH-nus, rhymes with bonus), a burden, obligation, especially a disagreeable responsibility."
Laity,[LAY-i-tee],"Nonprofessionals, laypeople collectively, all the people outside of a given profession or specialized field.<br>The adjective lay means nonprofessional, not belonging to a particular profession. A lay opinion of a legal case is an opinion from someone who is not a lawyer or a judge. A lay diagnosis of a disease is a diagnosis proffered by someone who is not a medical professional.<br>In its original and most precise sense, laity refers to all who do not belong to the clergy, to religious worshipers in general. Today laity may be used either in this way or to mean those who do not belong to a given profession.<br><br>Nonprofessionals, laypeople collectively, all the people outside of a given profession or specialized field; specifically, all who do not belong to the clergy, religious worshipers in general.<br>Corresponding adjective: lay, nonprofessional, not belonging to a particular profession; specifically, not a member of the clergy."
Pungent,[PUN-jint],"Sharp, penetrating, biting, acrid, caustic.<br>Pungent comes from the same Latin source as poignant (POYN-yint) and expunge—the Latin pungere, to pierce, prick. Pungent may refer to a literal piercing, to that which is sharp to the sense of taste or smell, or it may refer to a figurative piercing, to that which penetrates the mind or emotions.<br>A pungent sauce is sharp to the taste, perhaps spicy, sour, or bitter. A pungent critique or pungent humor is sharp and sometimes bitterly worded; it penetrates the mind or pierces the emotions in a direct and often painful way.<br><br>Sharp, penetrating, biting, acrid, caustic.<br>Etymology and usage: Pungent comes from the same Latin source as poignant and expunge-the Latin pungere, to pierce, prick. Pungent may refer to that which is sharp to the sense of taste or smell or to that which penetrates the mind or emotions."
Prosaic,[proh-ZAY-ik],"Dull, ordinary, uninteresting, unimaginative.<br>Synonyms of prosaic include commonplace, humdrum, tedious, dry, stale, mediocre, and matter-of-fact. And those are only the prosaic synonyms of prosaic. More difficult and interesting synonyms include insipid, which means tasteless, bland; pedestrian; vapid (rhymes with rapid), word 37 of Level 8; and jejune (ji-JOON), word 1 of Level 10.<br>Prosaic may be used literally to mean consisting of prose or of the nature of prose, as opposed to poetry. Because poetry is considered lovely and lyrical and prose is considered uninteresting and unimaginative, prosaic has come to be used figuratively to mean dull and ordinary. Today prosaic is most often used in this figurative sense. A prosaic performance is mediocre; a prosaic style is dry and stale; a prosaic explanation is humdrum, tedious, or matter- of-fact.<br><br>Dull, ordinary, uninteresting, unimaginative.<br>Synonyms: commonplace, humdrum, tedious, dry, stale, mediocre, matter-of-fact, insipid, pedestrian, vapid, jejune (Level 10, Word 1)."
Charlatan,[SHAHR-luh-tin],"A fake, quack, imposter, fraud, humbug; specifically, a person who pretends to have a special skill or knowledge.<br>The words charlatan and mountebank are close in meaning and were once synonymous. Mountebank (like mount a bank) comes from the Italian montambanco, one who gets up on a bench. By derivation a mountebank is a person who mounts a bench or platform and delivers a flamboyant sales pitch to attract customers and hawk his wares. In its earliest sense, a charlatan was a huckster who made elaborate and fraudulent claims about his merchandise. In olden days, charlatans and mountebanks would travel about selling trinkets, relics, and panaceas; they were the proverbial snake-oil salesmen.<br>Since the early nineteenth century, however, charlatan has been used to mean a fake or a quack, someone who pretends to have a special skill or knowledge and who covers up the fraud with an elaborate and sometimes intimidating verbal display. In The Wizard of Oz, the Wizard is a classic example of a charlatan.<br>Today charlatans and mountebanks continue to thrive not only at carnivals and on the street corner but in the office and the boardroom as well. They're the ones who are always giving you the glad hand and handing you a line. The difference between them is that the mountebank makes an impressive verbal display in an attempt to sell you a bill of goods, while the charlatan makes an impressive verbal display to hide the fact that he doesn't have the skill or knowledge he claims to possess.<br><br>A fake, quack, impostor, fraud, humbug; specifically, a person who pretends to have a special skill or knowledge.<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes the words charlatan and mountebank, which are close in meaning.<br>Memory aid: In The Wizard of Oz, the Wizard is a classic example of a charlatan."
Perfunctory,[pur-FUHNGK-tur-ee],"Mechanical, routine, listless, done merely as a duty, performed in an indifferent, halfhearted, superficial, and often careless way, without interest or enthusiasm.<br>Perfunctory comes from a Latin verb meaning to get through, be done with. The perfunctory worker is just trying to get through doing the job; the perfunctory teacher just wants to be done with the lesson; a perfunctory speech is mechanical, routine, delivered in a halfhearted, listless manner.<br><br>Mechanical, routine, listless; done merely as a duty; performed in an indifferent, halfhearted, superficial, and often careless way, without interest or enthusiasm."
Morass,"[muh-RAS, rhymes with alas]","Literally, a swamp, marsh, bog; figuratively, something that traps, confines, or confuses, a sticky situation or troublesome state of affairs: ""There was always a morass of paperwork on his desk""; ""She penetrated the morass of red tape at city hall""; ""Some people consider middle age the morass of life""; ""The project got bogged down in a morass of trivial details.""<br><br>Literally, a swamp, marsh, bog; figuratively, some-thing that traps, confines, or confuses, a sticky situation or troublesome state of affairs."
Sophistry,[SAHF-i-stree],"Deceptive reasoning, subtle and misleading argument: ""Voters today want candidates who address the issues, not ones who engage in mudslinging and sophistry.""<br>Sophistry comes ultimately from the Greek sophos, clever, wise, the source also of the word sophisticated. The corresponding adjective is sophistic (suh-FIS-tik) or sophistical (suh-FIS-ti-kul).<br>In ancient Greece, the Sophists (SAHF-ists) were teachers of rhetoric, politics, and philosophy who were notorious for their deceptive and oversubtle method of argumentation. The Sophists eventually came into contempt for accepting payment for their instruction. The word sophistry retains the stigma imputed to the clever Sophists so long ago. Today sophistry refers to speech or writing that is clever and plausible but marred by false or deceptive reasoning.<br>Deceptive reasoning, subtle and misleading argument.<br>Related word: sophisticated.<br>Corresponding adjective: sophistic or sophistical"
Prolific,[proh-LIF-ik],"Fruitful, fertile, productive.<br>Antonyms of prolific include unproductive, barren, sterile, impotent (IM-puh-tint), and effete (i-FEET).<br>Prolific comes from a Latin word meaning offspring, children, progeny.

A prolific period is a fruitful period, one marked by inventiveness and productivity.<br><br>Fruitful, fertile, productive.<br>Antonyms: unproductive, barren, sterile, impotent, effete."
Mundane,[MUHN-dayn or muhn-DAYN],"Of the world, worldly, earthly, material as distinguished from spiritual.<br>Synonyms of mundane include terrestrial, temporal (TEM-puh-rul, stress the first syllable), and secular. An unusual and literary synonym is sublunary (suhb-LOO-nur-ee). Sublunary means literally beneath the moon, and so of the world; sublunary beings are creatures who abide on Earth.<br>Antonyms of mundane include lofty, heavenly, sublime, celestial, ethereal (word 7 of Level 7), and extraterrestrial, which means literally beyond the earth.<br>Mundane is often used today to mean ordinary, humdrum, commonplace, banal, unimaginative, prosaic. All current dictionaries list this meaning, but some commentators on usage object to it. They argue that mundane's specific meaning should be protected, and the word should not be lumped with the many other words that mean ordinary and dull. It is a criticism I would advise you not to take lightly.<br>Jacques Barzun offers this sentence as an example of the debasement of mundane: ""A mundane sex life can be compared to a TV dinner, but it's not a gourmet banquet."" According to Barzun, ""sex life, of whatever kind, is inescapably mundane, and so is a gourmet banquet.""<br>In strict usage, mundane is reserved for things that are worldly as opposed to heavenly, material as opposed to spiritual, secular as opposed to religious. Mundane affairs are worldly affairs, not ordinary affairs. Mundane writing is not unimaginative or prosaic; it is concerned with worldly matters. Business is by nature mundane because it deals with concrete, material things rather than nebulous spiritual values. Politics is also mundane because it focuses on the issues and problems of the world. <br>Of the world, worldly, earthly, material as distinguished from spiritual.<br>Synonyms: terrestrial, temporal, secular, sublunary (suhb-LOO-nuh-ree).<br>Antonyms: lofty, heavenly, sublime, celestial, ethereal, extraterrestrial.<br>Usage tip: Some usage experts object to the use of mundane as a synonym of ordinary, humdrum, commonplace, banal, unimaginative, and prosaic.

Dissident,[DIS-i-dent],"Disagreeing, disaffected, dissenting, nonconformist.<br>Dissident comes from the Latin dis-, apart, and sedere, to sit, and by derivation means to sit apart; hence, to withdraw one's approval or belief, disagree.<br>The noun a dissident refers to a person who disagrees with a prevailing opinion, method, or doctrine.

Today both callow and the word fledgling are used of persons, behavior, or things that are immature or inexperienced. A fledgling is a young bird that has just acquired its feathers and is learning to fly. From that original sense,  fledgling has come to refer either to a young and inexperienced person or to something that is just getting off the ground, as a fledgling enterprise. Callow suggests an immaturity or inexperience manifested by a lack of sophistication. People who are callow know little of the ways of the world; they are green, still wet behind the ears.<br>Because callow means immature, it sometimes also suggests childishness or foolishness. For example, a callow remark may be not only unsophisticated but also downright silly. Synonyms of callow in this unfavorable sense include juvenile (preferably JOO-vuh-nil, but now also<br>JOO-vuh-nyl, which was originally British), sophomoric (SAHF-uh-MOR-ik),<br>Immature, inexperienced, unsophisticated, green, naive, lacking experience in and knowledge of the world.<br>N.B.

Acquiesce,[AK-wee-ES],"To agree without protest, accept without argument or resistance, give in quietly.<br>Synonyms of acquiesce include consent, comply, submit, assent, and accede (ak-SEED). The corresponding noun is acquiescence (AK-wee-ES -ints). Acquiescence means the act of acquiescing, passive agreement, quiet acceptance.<br>Assent, accede, and acquiesce all mean to agree in slightly different ways. Assent implies agreement reached after careful consideration or deliberation: ""The president of the company predicted that the stockholders would assent to the proposed merger."" Accede implies agreement in which one person or party gives in to persuasion or yields under pressure: ""Management is not likely to accede to the union's demands."" Acquiesce implies agreement offered in spite of tacit reservations. The person who acquiesces often is unwilling to agree but lacks the will or energy to resist: ""Despite her doubts about the plan, Lucy acquiesced""; ""Bob wasn't happy with the salary that Mercenary Media had offered him, but he knew he would have to either acquiesce or take an even lower-paying job.""<br>Acquiesce is sometimes followed by the preposition in: ""One member of the jury remained obstinate and would not acquiesce in the verdict""; ""The chief executive officer acquiesced in the board of directors’ decision.""<br><br>To agree without protest, accept without argument or resistance, give in quietly.<br>Synonyms: consent, comply, submit, assent, accede.<br>N.B.

Pontificate,[pahn-TIF-i-kayt],"To speak in a pompous and overbearing way, make pretentious or categorical statements, express one's opinion as though it were an official, authoritative decree.<br>The Roman Catholic pope is also known by two other names: the Bishop of Rome and the pontiff (PAHN-tif). Pontiff comes from the Latin Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome. As the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, the pontiff is responsible for interpreting religious doctrine, or dogma, and issuing official decrees, called papal bulls. To these official decrees the pontiff affixes a seal called a bulla (BUUL-uh).<br>In its original sense, to pontificate means to be a pontiff, to fulfill the office of a pope and issue official decrees on church doctrine or dogma.<br>To speak in a pompous and overbearing way; make pretentious or categorical statements; express one's opinion as though it were an official, authoritative decree.<br>Corresponding noun: pontification (pahn-TIF-iKAY-shin).<br>Related words: pontiff, the Roman Catholic pope, also known as the Bishop of Rome.

Deleterious,[DEL-i-TEER-ee-us],"Harmful, destructive, injurious, detrimental; especially, harmful to health or well-being.<br>Synonyms of deleterious include ruinous, noxious, pernicious (pur-NISH-us, word 10 of Level 7), and malignant (muh-LIG-nint). Antonyms include healthful, advantageous, wholesome, and salutary ( SAL-yuh-TER-ee).<br>Deleterious comes from a Greek word meaning destructive and may be applied to something that has a detrimental effect upon a person's health or well-being or to anything harmful or destructive. Smoking is deleterious, harmful to health. A divorce may be deleterious to children, injurious to their psychological well-being. An impetuous statement may have deleterious consequences. For example, you may daydream about stomping into your boss's office and giving the old pontificating windbag a piece of your verbally advantaged mind, but doing that probably would be deleterious to your career.<br><br>Harmful, destructive, injurious, detrimental; especially, harmful to health or well-being.<br>Synonyms: ruinous, noxious, pernicious, malignant.<br>Antonyms: healthful, advantageous, wholesome, salutary (SAL-yuh-ter-ee)."
Ambivalent,[am-BIV-uh-lint],"Uncertain, indecisive, having conflicting feelings or desires, simultaneously drawn in opposite directions, attracted to and repulsed by something at the same time.<br>The corresponding noun is ambivalence, a state of uncertainty or indecisiveness.<br>One meaning of the combining form ambi- is ""both,"" as in the words ambidextrous (AM-bi-DEK-strus), skilled with both hands, and ambivert (AM-bi-vurt), a person who is both introverted, inner-directed, and extroverted, outer-directed. Ambivalent combines ambi-, both, with the Latin valere, to be strong. When you are ambivalent on an issue, you have strong feelings both ways; you are simultaneously drawn in opposite directions. The ambivalent person has conflicting feelings or desires, and therefore is uncertain, indecisive.<br><br>Uncertain, indecisive; having conflicting feelings or desires; simultaneously drawn in opposite directions; attracted to and repulsed by something at the same time. Corresponding noun: ambivalence, a state of uncertainty or indecisiveness.<br>Etymology tip and related words: One meaning of the combining form ambi- is ""both,"" as in the words ambidextrous, skilled with both hands, and ambivert, a person who is both introverted, innerdirected, and extroverted, outer-directed. The word ambivalent combines ambi-, both, with the Latin valere, to be strong, to mean literally ""having strong feelings both ways""; hence, uncertain, indecisive."
Pensive,[PEN-siv],"Thoughtful, absorbed in thought, especially in a deep, dreamy, or melancholy way.<br>Synonyms of pensive include reflective, meditative, wistful, and contemplative (kun-TEM-pluh-tiv).<br>Pensive comes through an Old French verb meaning to think from the Latin pensare, to ponder, consider, weigh in the mind. When you are pensive, you are thinking deeply about something, pondering it, weighing it in your mind.<br>Pensive, contemplative, and wistful all mean thoughtful, but in different ways.<br>Wistful, which is related to the word wishful, suggests thoughtfulness marked by a strong and often sad longing or desire. When two lovers are apart, they are often wistful.<br>Contemplative (stress the second syllable), the adjective corresponding to the noun contemplation, suggests profound reflection usually directed toward achieving deeper understanding or enlightenment. Philosophers and prophets are contemplative.<br>Pensive suggests a deep, dreamy, and often melancholy thoughtfulness. A pensive mood is characterized by dreamy seriousness. When you grow pensive you become lost in thought, and probably have a slightly sad, faraway look in your eyes.<br>The corresponding noun is pensiveness: ""The most salient characteristic in the poetic temperament is pensiveness.""<br><br>Thoughtful, absorbed in thought, especially in a deep, dreamy, or melancholy way.<br>Synonyms: reflective, meditative, wistful, contemplative (kuhn-TEM-pluh-tiv).<br>N.B.

When you are pensive, you are thinking deeply about something, pondering it, weighing it in your mind.<br>Corresponding noun: pensiveness."
Impromptu,[im-PRAHMP-t(y)oo],"Made up or done on the spur of the moment, uttered or performed without preparation, improvised for the occasion.<br>Synonyms of impromptu include offhand, spontaneous, and extemporaneous (ek-STEM-puh-RAY-nee-us).<br>Impromptu comes from a Latin phrase meaning in readiness, at hand. By derivation, something impromptu lies close at hand, ready to use when the occasion arises. In modern usage impromptu may apply to either spontaneous expression or activity: an impromptu response is an offhand or off-the-cuff response; an impromptu performance is improvised for the occasion; an impromptu party is thrown on the spur of the moment.<br>Here's an image you can associate with the word impromptu that may help you remember what it means: Imagine yourself at a dinner party or wedding reception, chatting amiably with the people around you, when suddenly everyone in the room turns toward you and starts chanting ""Speech, speech!"" Although you are unprepared, you rise to the occasion and deliver a few urbane remarks. When your audience laughs at the right moment and applauds at the end, you are delighted.

Conjecture,[kun-JEK-chur],"To guess; especially, to make an educated guess; to form an opinion or make a judgment based on insufficient evidence.<br>Familiar synonyms of conjecture include to suppose, imagine, suspect, and presume.<br>To guess, to speculate, to surmise, and to conjecture all mean to form an opinion or reach a conclusion based upon uncertain or insufficient evidence.<br>To guess is the least reliable and most random of these words. When you guess you have a roughly equal chance of being right or wrong, and there is ample room for doubt about your opinion.<br>To speculate means to make a judgment based on observation and reasoning. When you speculate you form a reasonable opinion by evaluating whatever facts are at hand, however dubious they may be.<br>To surmise means to come to a conclusion by using one's intuition or imagination. When you surmise, you use your instinct and power of insight to make a judgment based on slender evidence.<br>Our keyword, conjecture, comes from the Latin con-, together, and jacere, to throw, and by derivation means to throw something together. In modern usage to conjecture means to take whatever evidence is available and quickly construct an opinion based on one's knowledge and experience—in short, to make an educated guess.<br>The corresponding noun a conjecture means an educated guess, an assumption or conclusion based on insufficient evidence.<br><br>To guess; especially, to make an educated guess; to form an opinion or make a judgment based on insufficient evidence.<br>Synonyms: suppose, imagine, suspect, presume.<br>N.B.

Surreptitious,[SUR-up-TISH-us],"Stealthy; characterized by secrecy and caution; done, made, obtained, or enjoyed in a secret and often sly or shifty manner, so as to avoid notice.<br>Synonyms of surreptitious include crafty, furtive (FUR-tiv), covert (traditionally and properly KUH-vurt, but now usually KOH-vurt), underhand, and clandestine (klan-DES-tin, word 6 of Level 2). Antonyms include evident, unconcealed, overt, aboveboard, and manifest.<br>Stealthy, furtive, clandestine, covert, and surreptitious all mean secret, hidden from the knowledge or view of others. Let's examine their connotations in order.<br>Stealthy is used of any secret or deceptive action that is careful, quiet, slow, and designed to conceal a motive: a cat stalks its prey in a stealthy manner; she heard the stealthy footsteps of a prowler outside the house.<br>Furtive adds to stealthy the suggestion of quickness and cunning. The word comes from the Latin furtum, theft, and that which is furtive exhibits the craftiness, dishonesty, and evasiveness of a thief: ""Their furtive glances at each other during the meeting convinced Jim that there was something fishy about the deal""; ""Suzanne knew her date with Arnold was going to be a disaster when she caught him making a furtive attempt to look down the front of her dress.""<br>Clandestine applies to that which is done secretly to conceal an evil, immoral, or illicit purpose: a clandestine love affair; a clandestine plot to overthrow the government.<br>Covert applies to anything deliberately covered up or disguised, and often suggests an effort to conceal something illegal or unethical. When we speak of an undercover operation, we usually mean a secret operation sanctioned by law, but when we speak of a covert operation, we usually mean one that is kept secret because it is criminal or corrupt.<br>I’d like to take a moment to explain why I prefer and recommend the pronunciation KUH-vurt. This is the traditional pronunciation, and it was the only way of saying the word recognized by dictionaries until the 1960s. Since then—and especially since the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s, when ""KOH-vurt operation"" was heard repeatedly on radio and television— the variant KOH-vurt has become so popular that several dictionaries now list it first.<br>Although few people today are aware that KUH-vurt was the earlier and only standard pronunciation, dictionaries still list KUH-vurt and many older educated speakers prefer KUH-vurt out of respect for the word's tradition, which dates back to the fourteenth century. If you’d rather go with the flow on this issue, that's fine—no one can say you're wrong; however, keep in mind that while KOH-vurt is recognized by current dictionaries, another popular variant, koh-VURT, is often not listed at all. On the other hand, if you are not afraid to distinguish yourself as a cultivated speaker at the risk of raising a few eyebrows, then I invite you to join me in the righteous cause of preserving the traditional pronunciation, KUH-vurt.<br>And now let's wind up this not-so-undercover discussion with a look at our keyword, surreptitious. It comes from a Latin word meaning stolen, kidnapped, and ultimately from the Latin verb surripere, to snatch, pilfer, take away or withdraw secretly. By derivation surreptitious means snatched while no one is looking, and in modern usage the word combines the deliberate, cautious secrecy suggested by stealthy with the crafty, evasive secrecy suggested by furtive. That which is surreptitious is done or acquired under the table, in a sly or shifty way, so as to avoid detection: ""For years Paul was so surreptitious about his drinking that no one at work knew he had a problem""; ""The general decided to launch a surreptitious attack under cover of darkness""; ""Larry was afraid the IRS would find out about his surreptitious real estate deals.""<br><br>Stealthy; characterized by secrecy and caution; done, made, obtained, or enjoyed in a secret and often sly or shifty manner, so as to avoid notice.<br>Synonyms: crafty, furtive, covert, underhand, clandestine (Level 2, Word 6).<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes the adjectives stealthy, furtive, clandestine, covert, and surreptitious, all of which mean secret, hidden from the knowledge or view of others.<br>Antonyms: evident, unconcealed, overt, aboveboard, manifest.<br>Etymology and usage: Surreptitious comes from the Latin verb surripere, to snatch, pilfer, take away or withdraw secretly. By derivation surreptitious means snatched while no one is looking, and in modern usage the word combines the deliberate, cautious secrecy suggested by stealthy with the crafty, evasive secrecy suggested by furtive.<br>Pronunciation tip: The traditional pronunciation of covert is KUH-vurt (like cover with a t at the end). Until the 1960s, KUH-vurt was the only pronunciation recognized by dictionaries. Since then the variant KOH-vurt has become so popular that several dictionaries now list it first. Dictionaries still list KUH-vurt and many older educated speakers prefer it out of respect for the word's tradition, which dates back to the 14th century. Another popular variant, koh-VURT, is often not listed at all (and is best avoided).<br>Those who preferto say KOH-vurt are not wrong; that pronunciation is now fully standard (meaning ""acceptable""). On the other hand, if you are not afraid to distinguish yourself as a cultivated speaker at the risk of raising a few eyebrows, then consider using the traditional pronunciation, KUH-vurt."
Exemplary,[ig-ZEM-pluh-ree],"Worthy of imitation, praiseworthy, commendable, serving as a model of excellence, appropriateness, or correctness.<br>Synonyms of exemplary include ideal, admirable, meritorious (MER-iTOR-ee-us), estimable (ES-ti-muh-buul), and laudable (word 25 of Level 4). Antonyms include shameful, disreputable, contemptible, deplorable (di-PLOR-uh-buul), ignominious (IG-nuh-MIN-ee-us), odious (OH-dee-us), and heinous (HAY-nis, rhymes with anus).<br>By the way, heinous means reprehensible, wicked, evil, as a heinous crime, a heinous lie. I have heard scores of educated people mispronounce it as HEE-nis, HEE-nee-us, and HAY-nee-us. The best I can say about these pronunciations is that they are creative but wrong. The only pronunciation recognized by dictionaries is HAY-nis, and anything else is utterly heinous, evil, wicked, reprehensible.<br>Now back to our more pleasant keyword, exemplary, which comes from the same Latin source as the word example. By derivation, something exemplary sets an example, and is therefore worthy of imitation. Exemplary conduct is praiseworthy. An exemplary performance is commendable.<br>Verbal Advantage teaches you how to use words in an exemplary manner.<br><br>Worthy of imitation, praiseworthy, commendable, serving as a model of excellence, appropriateness, or correctness.<br>Synonyms: ideal, admirable, meritorious, estimable, laudable (Level 4, Word 25).<br>Antonyms: shameful, disreputable, contemptible, deplorable, ignominious, odious, heinous (HAY-nus).<br>Etymology: Exemplary comes from the same Latin source as the word example.

Impeccable,[im-PEK-uh-buul],"Perfect, faultless, flawless; free from faults or imperfections. Also, unable to do wrong, incapable of sin.<br>Equally challenging synonyms of impeccable include unimpeachable and irreproachable. Challenging antonyms of impeccable include reprehensible, censurable (SEN-shur-uh-buul), and culpable (KUHL-puh-buul).<br>Earlier in this level I told you about the prefix in-, which may mean ""in"" or ""into"" or have a privative function, depriving or taking away the meaning of what follows. Impeccable combines this privative prefix in-, meaning ""not,"" with the Latin peccare, to make a mistake, do wrong, blunder, sin. By derivation, impeccable means not able to make a mistake, incapable of sinning or doing wrong; hence, perfect, faultless.<br>Now, if you've been reading carefully I bet you're wondering why in the world I'm talking about the prefix in- when the prefix in impeccable is im-. Well, my verbally advantaged friend, your exemplary guide through the oddities of the English language has the answer, and here it is:<br>When the prefix in- is attached to a word beginning with the letter b, p, or m, the n changes to an m. Thus, imbalanced means not balanced; impossible means not possible; and immutable means not mutable, not changeable, fixed. Similarly, when the prefix in- appears before a word beginning with l or r, the n changes to an l or an r: illogical means not logical; irreproachable means not reproachable, without fault or blame, and therefore impeccable, perfect, flawless.<br>So now that you know how the spelling of the prefix in- changes, I suppose you're wondering why it changes. The answer is simple: ease of pronunciation. If we had to say in peccable and in reproachable, it would be not only in logical but also nearly in possible. The altered spelling of the prefix makes these and dozens of other words easier to pronounce.<br>Now let's take a look at the closely related words impeccable, immaculate, and infallible, all of which employ the privative prefix in-, meaning not.<br>The adjective fallible comes from the Latin verb fallere, to deceive, lead astray, cause to make a mistake. In modern usage fallible means capable of error or likely to be wrong, as human beings are fallible creatures. Attach the prefix in- to fallible and you have the word infallible, not fallible, not capable of making an error, unable to fail. As your infallible guide through<br>Verbal Advantage, I assure you that this program is an infallible method of building your vocabulary.<br>The unusual noun macula (MAK-yuh-luh) means a spot or stain. Its direct Latin root, macula, meant either a physical spot or blotch or a moral blemish, a stain on one's character. In current usage macula refers specifically either to a blemish on the skin or to a sunspot; the corresponding adjective maculate means stained, blemished, impure, corrupt. Attach the prefix in- to the adjective maculate and you have the word immaculate, not maculate, unstained, spotless. An immaculate house is spick-and-span; an immaculate complexion has no blemishes; an immaculate reputation or background is spotless, clean as a whistle. In Roman Catholicism, the Immaculate Conception is the doctrine that the Virgin Mary was miraculously conceived without the moral stain of original sin.<br>And now for our keyword, impeccable. From its Latin root, peccare, to make a mistake, blunder, sin, English has also inherited three other words: the noun peccadillo (PEK-uh-DIL-oh) means a small sin, minor fault or flaw; the adjective peccant (PEK-int) means guilty, sinful, culpable; and the adjective peccable (PEK-uh-buul) means liable to sin or do wrong. Slap the privative prefix in- onto the unfortunate peccable and you have its more pleasant antonym, impeccable, incapable of sin, unable to do wrong, and therefore free from all faults or imperfections. Impeccable taste is faultless; impeccable speech is flawless; an impeccable performance is perfect.<br>(1)	Perfect, faultless, flawless; free from faults or imperfections.<br>(2)	Unable to do wrong, incapable of sin.<br>Synonyms: unimpeachable, irreproachable.<br>Antonyms: reprehensible, censurable, culpable.<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes the words impeccable, immaculate, and infallible.<br>Etymology: Impeccable combines the privative prefix in-, meaning ""not,"" with the Latin peccare, to make a mistake, do wrong, blunder, sin. By derivation, impeccable means not able to make a mistake, incapable of sinning or doing wrong; hence, perfect, faultless.<br>N.B. When the prefix in- is attached to a word beginning with the letter B, P, or M, the N changes to an M: imbalanced means not balanced; impossible means not possible; and immutable means not mutable, not changeable, fixed. When the prefix inappears before a word beginning with L or R, the N changes to an L or an R: illogical means not logical; irreproachable means not reproachable, without fault or blame. These alterations in the spelling of the prefix in- have occurred to make these and dozens of other analogous words easier to pronounce.<br>Additional useful words: fallible (FAL-i-buul), capable of error or likely to be wrong; macula (MAK-yuh-luh), a spot or stain, specifically a blemish on the skin or a sunspot; maculate (MAKyuh-lit), stained, blemished, impure, corrupt; peccadillo (PEK-uh-DILoh), a small sin, minor fault or flaw; peccant (PEK-int), guilty, sinful, culpable; and peccable (PEK-uh-buul), liable to sin or do wrong."
Attest,[uh-TEST],"To affirm to be true, genuine, or correct; certify or authenticate officially; stand as proof or evidence of.<br>Attest comes from the Latin ad, to, and testari, to bear witness, and ultimately from testis, a witness. From the same Latin testis, witness, English has inherited a number of other words, including testify, testimony, testimonial, and the legal terms testator (TES-tay-tur), a person who has made a valid will, and intestate (in-TES-tayt), which means not having made a legal will.<br>By derivation, attest means to bear witness to, give testimony, and today the word may be used in this literal sense, as to attest to someone's whereabouts, to furnish references who will attest to your skills and qualifications. (Note that in this sense attest is followed by to.) Attest is also used to mean to affirm to be true, genuine, or correct, or to stand as proof or evidence of: ""Many studies attest the deleterious effects of saturated fat and cholesterol""; ""Michelangelo's David is but one of many masterpieces that attest the greatness of this Renaissance artist.""<br><br>(1)	To affirm to be true, genuine, or correct; certify or authenticate officially; stand as proof or evidence of.<br>(2)	To bear witness to, give testimony.<br>Etymology and related words: Attest comes from the Latin ad, to, and testari, to bear witness, and ultimately from testis, a witness, the source also of the words testify; testimony; testimonial; testator (TES-tay-tur), a person who has made a valid will; and intestate (in-TES-tayt), not having made a legal will."
Copious,[KOH-pee-us],"Abundant, plentiful, large in amount or number.<br>Synonyms of copious include ample, bountiful, and profuse (pruh-FYOOS). Antonyms include scanty, meager, sparse, and paltry (PAWL-tree).<br>Copious comes from the Latin copia, abundance, plenty, and means literally abundant, plentiful. From the same Latin copia, plenty, and cornu, a horn, comes the English word cornucopia (KORN-(y)uh-KOH-pee-uh), a horn of plenty. Historically, a cornucopia is a symbol of abundance and prosperity in the form of a goat's horn overflowing with fruit, flowers, and grain. In modern usage, cornucopia is often applied to any overflowing stock or supply, as a cornucopia of menu selections, or a cornucopia of products and services.<br>The adjective copious may be used of anything that exists or is provided in abundance. Copious praise is abundant praise; a copious harvest is a plentiful harvest; copious information is a great supply of information; copious speech overflows with words.<br><br>Abundant, plentiful, large in amount or number.<br>Synonyms: ample, bountiful, profuse.<br>Antonyms: scanty, meager, sparse, paltry.<br>Etymology and related word: Copious comes from the Latin copia, abundance, plenty, the source also of the English word cornucopia, a horn of plenty, hence, any overflowing stock or supply."
Fallacious,[fuh-LAY-shus],"False, misleading, deceptive, invalid, based on a fallacy.<br>Synonyms of fallacious include erroneous (i-ROH-nee-us), spurious (SPYOOR-ee-us), untenable (uhn-TEN-uh-buul), illusory (i-LOO-suh-ree), and sophistical (suh-FIS-ti-kul).<br>The noun fallacy (FAL-uh-see) means a false or misleading idea, statement, or argument. Fallacy and sophistry (SAHF-i-stree, word 20 of this level) are close in meaning. A fallacy is a misleading or deceptive argument that violates the laws of reasoning. Sophistry refers to reasoning that deliberately uses fallacies, misleading arguments, to confuse or deceive.<br>Both fallacy and the adjective fallacious come from the Latin fallere, to deceive, lead astray. That which is fallacious is based on a fallacy, and is therefore misleading, deceptive, false.

Recrimination,[ri-KRIM-uh-NAY-shin],"A countercharge or counteraccusation.<br>Recrimination combines the prefix re-, which means ""back"" or ""again,"" with the Latin verb criminari, to accuse, bring a charge against, and means literally to accuse in return, accuse again.

Volatile,[VAHL-uh-tul; British say VAHL-uh-tyl],"Changeable, unstable, inconstant, likely to change or shift rapidly and unpredictably: The stock market is often volatile; a person may have volatile moods; the weather in New England is notoriously volatile.<br>Synonyms of volatile include fickle, flighty, capricious (kuh-PRISH-us, word 11 of Level 1), erratic, protean (PROH-tee-in), and mercurial (mur-KYUR-ee-ul).<br>Antonyms include stable, fixed, steadfast, invariable, immutable, and quiescent (kwy-ES-int, word 22 of Level 3).<br>Volatile, which entered English in the early 1600s, has a volatile history, full of many shifts and changes in meaning. The word comes from the Latin  volare, to fly, and its original meaning was ""flying"" or ""having the power to fly."" Today volatile is rarely used in this sense, and instead we have the word volant (VOH-lant), which came into the language shortly before volatile from the same Latin volare, to fly. Volant means flying, able to fly, or quick, nimble, agile.<br>The fickle, unpredictable volatile then came to mean evaporating quickly, easily vaporized, as a volatile oil or liquid. In the science of chemistry it is still used in this way, and today it would be unusual but not outlandish for an essayist to write about the volatile morning dew, or for a weathercaster to speak of volatile fog or clouds, or for a TV chef to discuss the volatile nature of wine used in cooking.<br>By the mid-seventeenth century the inconstant volatile had acquired its most durable meaning: changeable, unstable, inconstant, likely to change or shift rapidly and unpredictably. In this sense it is a close synonym of capricious and mercurial. Out of this notion of changeability and inconstancy, volatile gained two more meanings: fleeting, vanishing swiftly, transient, ephemeral; and also lighthearted, lively and carefree, whimsical, prone to flights of fancy.<br>In the second half of the twentieth century volatile took on yet another meaning: explosive, likely to erupt into violence. You will often hear volatile used this way in news reports about domestic or international affairs characterized by tension and sporadic conflict. This sense is an outgrowth of the meaning ""unstable, unpredictable,"" for when a situation is unstable or unpredictable it is often likely to explode or erupt in violence.<br>Finally, in the 1990s volatile acquired one more sense. According to Webster's New World Dictionary, third college edition, in the jargon of computer science volatile is used to mean pertaining to ""memory that does not retain stored data when the power supply is disconnected.""<br>Despite its capricious, changeable history, volatile has remained close to its roots. For as I'm sure you can see, all the various senses of volatile incorporate the notions of flight, flightiness, and swift, unpredictable change suggested by the word's Latin root, volare, to fly. When you see or hear volatile used, and when you use it yourself, remember that in all of its senses the word describes that which can swiftly fly away from one condition or mood into another.<br>Volatile is the adjective; the corresponding noun is volatility.<br><br>(1) Changeable, unstable, inconstant, likely to change or shift rapidly and unpredictably.<br>Synonyms: fickle, flighty, capricious (Level 1, Word 11), erratic, protean, mercurial.<br>Antonyms: stable, fixed, steadfast, invariable, immutable, quiescent (Level 3, Word 22).<br>N.B.
