Pedagogic is the adjective corresponding to the noun pedagogue (PED-uh-GAHG). A pedagogue is a teacher, but today the word is sometimes used disparagingly to mean a teacher who is strict, narrow-minded, or dogmatic.<br>The adjective didactic comes from the Greek didaktikos, skillful or adept at teaching. In modern usage didactic means designed or intended to teach. A didactic paradigm is a model or example that serves to instruct. A didactic treatise is an instructive treatise, one that teaches a lesson, principle, or rule of conduct.

Truncate,"[TRUHNG-kayt, like trunk + ate]","To cut short, shorten by cutting or lopping off.<br>Synonyms of truncate include condense, abridge, abbreviate, and curtail. Antonyms include lengthen, extend, elongate, prolong, and protract (word 25 of Level 3).<br>Truncate comes from the Latin verb truncare, to maim, mutilate, shorten by cutting off, which in turn comes from truncus. As an adjective, the Latin truncus means maimed, mutilated, cut short or lopped off; as a noun, truncus denotes a tree that has been cut down, so that only the stump remains.<br>Probably because the history of truncate contains so much maiming and mutilation, the word usually suggests a more severe or substantial cutting or shortening than its synonyms condense, abridge, abbreviate, and curtail. Of all these words, curtail comes closest to the severity of truncate.<br>Truncate may refer to a cutting short in number, length, or duration. An editor truncates an article or a book by cutting out large sections of it. A heart attack or severe illness can truncate a life, cut it short early or in its prime. And a company might decide to truncate its workforce, perhaps by cutting out several departments. Of course, company executives would never use the word truncate. They would say they were downsizing, which makes it sound as if they're just putting the company on a low-fat diet instead of engaging in an act of corporate mutilation.<br>The corresponding adjective truncated means cut short, abbreviated, terminated abruptly, as a truncated meeting, a truncated explanation, a brief period of economic growth and prosperity truncated by recession.<br><br>To cut short, shorten by cutting or lopping off.<br>Synonyms: condense, abridge, abbreviate, curtail.<br>Antonyms: lengthen, extend, elongate, prolong, protract (Level 3, Word 25).<br>Etymology: Latin truncare, to maim, mutilate, shorten by cutting off.

Antonyms include mundane (word 22 of Level 4), terrestrial, and sublunary (suhb-LOO-nur-ee).<br>In one of its senses, the word ether refers to an imaginary substance that the ancients believed filled the upper regions of space. In this primitive cosmology, ether was the lightest and most subtle of the elements, which included earth, water, and fire. At first the adjective ethereal meant pertaining to the ether, the upper regions of space, and therefore heavenly, celestial: ethereal beings are heavenly beings, creatures or gods that inhabit the upper regions. Out of this notion of elemental intangibility, ethereal came to mean very light, airy, of unearthly delicacy or refinement, as ethereal music, ethereal voices, ethereal beauty, or an ethereal presence or sensation.<br><br>Heavenly, not earthly; hence, very light, airy, delicate, or refined.<br>Synonyms: celestial, lofty, elevated, tenuous, rarefied, sublime.<br>Antonyms: mundane (Level 4, Word 22), terrestrial, sublunary.<br>Related word: ether, which in one of its senses refers to an imaginary substance that the ancients believed filled the upper regions of space.

Senescent,[si-NES-int],"Aging, growing old, on the decline.<br>The adjective senescent comes from the Latin senex, which means ""old.""

By derivation, that which is pernicious leads to destruction, ruin, or death.<br>In modern usage pernicious suggests an insidious, evil, or corrupting influence that harms or destroys by undermining and weakening. The disease called pernicious anemia weakens the body's ability to absorb vitamin B12. A pernicious influence is a deleterious, corrupting, or deadly influence.

Scholars are often disputatious, and it goes without saying that politics is disputatious.<br>Litigious (li-TIJ-us) means tending to engage in lawsuits or litigation. Although it is entirely appropriate to say that the legal profession is litigious, meaning that its business is to engage in lawsuits, in current usage litigious often implies an overeagerness to settle every minor dispute in court.<br>Contentious (kun-TEN-shus) comes from the Latin contentio, striving, effort, and ultimately from contendere, to strain or strive against another.

By derivation, assiduous means sitting down and working diligently until a job is done.<br>In modern usage assiduous means done with persistent, careful, and untiring attention, constant in application or effort.

Nascent,[NAS-int—recommended—or NAY-sint],"Beginning to exist or develop; in the process of being born or begun; coming or having just come into being.<br>Synonyms of nascent include emerging, dawning, developing, commencing, embryonic (EM-bree-AHN-ik), incipient (in-SIP-ee-int), and inchoate (in-KOH-it, word 35 of this level).<br>Antonyms include ancient, extinct, outworn, outmoded, antiquated, obsolete, senescent (word 9 of Level 7), and antediluvian (AN-tee-di-LOO -vee-in). Antediluvian means of the time before the Deluge (DEL-yooj), the great flood described in the first book of the Bible, Genesis; hence, extremely old or old-fashioned: ""The horse and buggy is an antediluvian mode of transportation""; ""Bob's father still prefers to write on an antediluvian manual typewriter.""<br>There is nothing antediluvian about the word nascent, which comes from the Latin verb nasci, to be born. By derivation, nascent means in the process of being born, beginning to exist or develop. We speak of a nascent idea, a nascent republic, a nascent relationship, nascent anxiety, or nascent hope. The corresponding noun is nascency (NAS-in-see or NAY-), which means birth or beginning: ""The year 1776 marks the nascency of American democracy.""<br><br>Beginning to exist or develop; in the process of being born or begun; coming or having just come into being.<br>Synonyms: emerging, dawning, developing, commencing, embryonic, incipient, inchoate (Level 7, Word 35).<br>Antonyms: ancient, extinct, outworn, outmoded, antiquated, obsolete, senescent (Level 7, Word 9), antediluvian. Antediluvian means of the time before the Deluge, the great flood described in the first book of the Bible, Genesis; hence, extremely old or oldfashioned.<br>Etymology: Latin nasci, to be born.<br>Corresponding noun: nascency, birth or beginning."
Accede,[ak-SEED],"To consent, yield, give in or agree to.<br>Synonyms of accede include comply, submit, assent, concur (word 18 of Level 1), and acquiesce (word 31 of Level 4). Antonyms include resist, disagree, oppose, protest, contradict, dispute, dissent, wrangle, and cavil (word 29 of Level 3).<br>The verbs accede, acquiesce, assent, concur, and consent all suggest agreement. Consent implies voluntary agreement: You consent to another's wishes. Concur implies agreement reached independently: When you concur with a statement, you agree on your own without pressure from the person who made it. Assent implies agreement reached after careful consideration or deliberation: When you assent to a plan, you agree to it after discussion or careful thought. Acquiesce implies agreement offered despite tacit reservations: the person who acquiesces often is unwilling to agree but lacks the will or the energy to resist.<br>Accede, our keyword, comes from the Latin accedere, to approach, come near. Accede implies agreement in which one person or party gives in to persuasion or yields under pressure. When you accede, you yield your position and give in to a demand or request, often under pressure: ""They acceded to the proposal on certain conditions""; ""After renegotiating various points, we acceded to the terms of the contract""; ""The union refused to accede to the company's demands.""<br>Accede may also be used to mean to attain or assume an office or title, as to accede to the throne, to accede to the presidency.<br><br>To consent, yield, give in or agree to.<br>Synonyms: comply, submit, assent, concur (Level 1, Word 18), acquiesce (Level 4, Word 31).<br>Antonyms: resist, disagree, oppose, protest, contradict, dispute, dissent, wrangle, cavil (Level 3, Word 29).<br>Etymology: Latin accedere, to approach, come near.<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes the verbs to accede, acquiesce, assent, concur, and consent.<br>Usage: Accede implies yielding a position or giving in to a demand or request, often under pressure. Accede may also be used to mean to attain or assume an office or title (to accede to the throne or to the presidency)."
Magnanimous,[mag-NAN-i-mus],"Noble, honorable, generous in overlooking injury or insult, high-minded, unselfish.<br>People with an abiding faith in the goodness of human nature believe that we are noble, unselfish, and generous more often than we are ignoble, selfish, and grasping. The English vocabulary, however, suggests otherwise. In a language comprising well over a million words, there is a dearth of synonyms for magnanimous. Chalk up the words noble, honorable, generous, unselfish, and high-minded, and the list is almost exhausted; if you stretch things a bit you can add courageous, exalted, and  lofty for the noble, high-minded connotation of magnanimous, and charitable, altruistic (AL-troo-IS-tik), and beneficent (buh-NEF-i-sint) for the generous, unselfish connotation.<br>On the other hand, the language abounds with antonyms for magnanimous. Browse through any thesaurus and you will find a cornucopia (KOR-n(y)uh-KOH-pee-uh) of these ignoble, selfish words. Here is a selection of my favorites: vile, contemptible, malicious, despicable (traditionally and properly DES-pik-uh-buul), ignominious (IG-noh-MIN-ee-us), covetous (KUHV-uh-tus), avaricious (word 40 of Level 2), mercenary (word 14 of Level 3), venal (VEE-nul), vindictive (word 39 of Level 5), churlish, sordid, abject (word 50 of Level 4), servile, sycophantic (SIK-uh-FAN-tik), and finally, because we can't go on with this forever, we have the utterly ignoble word pusillanimous (PYOO-si-LAN -i-mus), which means cowardly, weak, and mean-spirited. We will discuss pusillanimous further in Level 9.<br>The noble word magnanimous comes from the Latin magnus, great, and  animus, spirit, and means literally great-spirited. In modern usage magnanimous means having or displaying a noble and generous soul; specifically, showing noble generosity in overlooking injury or insult. It applies either to persons who possess a generous, lofty, and courageous spirit, or to persons or actions that are unselfish, high-minded, and free from pettiness or vindictiveness.<br>Noble and magnanimous are close in meaning. According to the Century Dictionary, noble expresses that which ""in character and conduct…is appropriate to exalted place,"" and ""admits no degree of the petty, mean, base, or dishonorable."" Magnanimous ""describes that largeness of mind that has breadth enough and height enough to take in large views, broad sympathies, [and] exalted standards. It generally implies superiority of position: as, a nation so great as the United States…can afford to be magnanimous in its treatment of injuries or affronts from nations comparatively weak.""<br>The corresponding noun is magnanimity, noble generosity, greatness or dignity of mind or heart: ""He is a man of such magnanimity that he will do everything in his power to aid a worthy cause, no matter how unpopular it may be.""<br><br>Noble, honorable; generous in overlooking injury or insult; high-minded, unselfish.<br>Synonyms: courageous, exalted, lofty (for the noble, high-minded connotation); charitable, altruistic, beneficent (for the generous, unselfish connotation).<br>Antonyms: vile, contemptible, malicious, despicable, ignominious, covetous, avaricious (Level 2, Word 40), mercenary (Level 3, Word 14), venal (Level 9, Word 14), vindictive (Level 5, Word 39), churlish, sordid, abject, servile, sycophantic, pusillanimous (Level 9, Word 16).<br>Etymology: Latin magnus, great, and animus, spirit.<br>N.B.

Nonage,[NAHN-ij],"Immaturity, youth; especially the period of legal minority, the state of being a minor in the eyes of the law.<br>Nonage comes through Middle English from Anglo-French, the language of the Normans, who conquered England in 1066. Nonage combines the prefix non-, meaning ""not,"" with the word age to mean literally ""not of age.""<br>Nonage may be used either generally to refer to any period of immaturity, or specifically to mean the state of being a minor. People in their nonage are under the lawful age for doing certain things such as marrying, making contracts, driving a motor vehicle, voting, or buying alcoholic beverages.<br><br>Immaturity, youth; especially the period of legal minority, the state of being a minor in the eyes of the law.<br>Etymology: Middle English, from AngloFrench, combining the prefix non-, not, with the word age (literally, ""not of age"")."
Invective,[in-VEK-tiv],"Vehement or abusive language involving bitter, scathing accusations or denunciations.<br>Synonyms of invective include slander, defamation, aspersion (uh-SPUR-zhun), objurgation (word 12 of this level), billingsgate (BIL -ingz-GAYT), vituperation (vy-T(Y)OO-puh-RAY-shin), and obloquy (AHB-luh-kwee).<br>Antonyms of invective include praise, commendation, adulation (AJ-uhLAY-shin), eulogy (YOO-luh-jee), and encomium (en-KOH-mee-um).<br>Let's take a closer look at the words billingsgate, vituperation, and obloquy, which, like invective, denote various forms of abusive language.<br>Billingsgate comes from the name of one of the ancient gates of the city of London, near which stood a fish market. Apparently, not only did this market smell foul, as fish markets often do, but legend has it that the vendors and patrons also stunk up the place by exhibiting a proclivity for foul language. From those foul beginnings, billingsgate has come to mean abusive language that is filthy and obscene.<br>Vituperation has no such odorous etymology. Vituperation comes from a<br>Latin verb meaning to scold or blame, and today denotes either a prolonged and vicious scolding or harsh, abusive language that violently scolds or blames.<br>Obloquy comes from the Latin ob-, meaning ""against,"" and loqui, to speak. Obloquy refers to abusive language—and particularly abusive speech—whose express purpose is to defame or disgrace. If someone tries to ruin your reputation by abusing you either in conversation or in print, that's obloquy. And when obloquy strikes, you can react with equanimity (word 46 of Level 6), which you will recall means ""composure, calm indifference,"" or you can respond with invective, bitter, vehement accusations or denunciations.<br>In Synonyms Discriminated, published in 1879, Charles Johnson Smith explains that ""Abuse…is…personal and coarse, being conveyed in harsh and unseemly terms, and dictated by angry feeling and bitter temper. Invective is more commonly aimed at character or conduct, and may be conveyed in writing and in refined language, and dictated by indignation against what is in itself blameworthy. It often, however, means public abuse under such restraints as are imposed by position and education.""<br>More than a hundred years later, Smith's distinction still holds: When someone uses coarse, harsh, or obscene language to disparage or intimidate another, we call it verbal abuse. When the abuse occurs in a public context, and takes the form of a bitter, vehement verbal attack that remains just barely within the bounds of decency, we call it invective. Thus, today we speak of a newspaper editorial full of invective; the invective exchanged in a bitter political contest; a snubbed author hurling invective at his critics; or an opinionated radio talk show host who issues a stream of invective against his ideological foes.<br>Invective comes ultimately from the Latin verb invehere, which means to attack with words. From the same source comes the English verb to inveigh (in-VAY). Like its Latin ancestor, to inveigh means to attack violently with words, protest furiously or express angry disapproval. Inveigh is always followed by against, as to inveigh against authority; to inveigh against an unfair company policy; to inveigh against an abuse of First Amendment rights.<br><br>Vehement or abusive language involving bitter, scathing accusations or denunciations.<br>Synonyms: slander, defamation, aspersion, objurgation (Level 7, Word 12), billingsgate, vituperation, obloquy.<br>Antonyms: praise, commendation, adulation, eulogy, encomium.<br>N.B. This discussion covers the origin and precise meaning of the words billingsgate, vituperation, and obloquy, and distinguishes the words abuse and invective.<br>Etymology and related word: Latin invehere, to attack with words, the source also of the English verb to inveigh, to attack violently with words, protest furiously or express angry disapproval. Inveigh is always followed by against (inveigh against an unfair company policy; inveigh against an abuse of First Amendment rights)."
Machination,[MAK-i-NAY-shin],"A crafty or treacherous plot, malicious scheme, cunning design or plan to achieve a sinister purpose.<br>Synonyms of machination include stratagem, conspiracy, contrivance, ruse (properly ROOZ, rhyming with lose and shoes), and cabal (kuh-BAHL or kuh-BAL).<br>Machination comes from the Latin verb machinari, to plot, devise, contrive to do evil, which comes in turn from the noun machina, a device or contrivance for performing work. From the spelling of the Latin machina it's easy to deduce that it is also the source of the familiar and versatile word machine, something devised to perform work.<br>The Latin machina also appears in a phrase that has been taken whole into English: deus ex machina (DAY-uus eks MAH-ki-nuh), which means literally ""a god out of a machine."" In his delightful book Amo, Amas, Amat: How to Use Latin to Your Own Advantage and to the Astonishment of Others (1985), Eugene Ehrlich translates deus ex machina as ""an unlikely and providential intervention,"" and explains that the phrase ""describes an unexpected occurrence that rescues someone or something from an apparently hopeless predicament."" Although deus ex machina is Latin, Ehrlich tells us that ""the expression has its origin in ancient Greek theater…. When the complexities of plot and character appeared incapable of resolution, a god was set down on stage by a mechanical crane to sort out things and make them right.""<br>Our keyword, machination, means a crafty plot, malicious scheme, cunning plan to achieve a sinister purpose, as a machination to seize power. In current usage the singular form is less common than the plural, machinations: ""Ralph's deviousness enabled him to climb the company ladder, but when his machinations finally were exposed he found himself demoted to the mailroom."" You might think that machinations are confined to the crafty worlds of business and politics and to the sinister arena of international espionage, but the word is also sometimes used in a literary or metaphorical way, in such phrases as ""the machinations of love,"" which can often be a treacherous business, or ""the machinations of our dreams,"" which are often devious, or ""the machinations of destiny,"" which may seem to plot against us.<br>I shall conclude this crafty lesson with an important pronunciation tip. Certain educated speakers, probably misled by the sound of the ch in machine, have adopted the pronunciation mashination. This beastly mash ination is a classic example of what happens when people learn the meaning of a word but don't bother to check the pronunciation in a dictionary. They simply looked at machination, saw the word machine inside, and decided to say mashination, blithely assuming that their false analogy was right without pausing to consider that the pronunciation they have just invented might not be the one most educated speakers prefer. That, in a nutshell, is how eccentric pronunciations are born—and the worst thing about it is that the mispronouncers often flaunt their inventions, as if to show that they have placed their personal stamp on the language by making up a bizarre way to say a word.<br>Some dictionaries now recognize mashination, but list it after the preferred pronunciation, in which the ch is pronounced like k: (MAK-i-NAY -shin).<br><br>A crafty or treacherous plot, malicious scheme, cunning design or plan to achieve a sinister purpose (often used in the plural, machinations).<br>Synonyms: stratagem, conspiracy, contrivance, ruse, cabal (kuh-BAHL).<br>Etymology: Latin machinari, to plot, devise, contrive to do evil, from machina, a device or contrivance for performing work.<br>Related word and phrase: The Latin machina is also the source of machine, something devised to perform work, and it appears in a Latin expression now used in English: deus ex machina (DAY-uus eks MAH-ki-nah). Deus ex machina means literally ""a god out of a machine""; in English it means ""an unexpected occurrence that rescues someone or something from an apparently hopeless predicament"" (Eugene Ehrlich, Amo, Amas, Amat, and More). Pronunciation tip: The ch in machine is soft; the ch in machination is hard, like a K. Do not say mashination (a recent, erroneous variant). The preferred pronunciation is MAK-i-NAY-shin."
Docile,[DAHS-’l],"Submissive, obedient, compliant; easy to direct, manage, or supervise; following instructions.<br>Synonyms of docile include amenable, deferential, malleable (word 29 of Level 2), tractable, acquiescent, and obsequious (word 3 of this level).<br>Antonyms include willful, wayward, headstrong, obstinate (word 34 of Level 1), intractable (word 12 of Level 5), intransigent (in-TRAN-si-jint, word 4 of Level 8), and refractory (word 42 of Level 6).<br>Docile comes through the Latin docilis, teachable, from docere, to teach, instruct. From the same source comes the word docent (DOH-sint). A docent is either a teacher at a university who is not a member of the faculty, or a lecturing tour guide in a museum, cathedral, or some such place of cultural interest. By the way, in your travels through museums and the like, you may hear the phrase ""docent guide,"" which is redundant. A docent guide is a ""guide guide,"" because docent means a guide trained to lecture on what is being viewed. Think of me as your docent in the museum of the English language.<br>Our keyword, docile, by derivation means teachable. In modern usage docile has two closely related senses. It may mean easy to teach or instruct, as a docile pupil, or it may mean submissive, obedient, as a docile pet, or a docile employee—which is not to imply that employees in general are analogous to pets, but only that some employees are docile, easy to direct, manage, or supervise.<br>The corresponding noun is docility: ""A dictatorship or totalitarian state derives its power only from the docility of the people.""<br>Occasionally you may hear docile pronounced DOH-syl. DOH-syl is the preference of British and Canadian speakers. The preferred American pronunciation is DAHS-’l.<br><br>Submissive, obedient, compliant; easy to direct, manage, or supervise; following instructions.<br>Synonyms: amenable, deferential, malleable (Level 2, Word 29), tractable, acquiescent, obsequious (Level 7, Word 3).<br>Antonyms: willful, wayward, headstrong, obstinate (Level 1, Word 34), intractable (Level 5, Word 12), intransigent, refractory (Level 6, Word 42).<br>Etymology and related word: Latin docilis, teachable, from docere, to teach, instruct. From the same source comes docent (DOH-sint), which may mean either a teacher at a university who is not a member of the faculty, or a lecturing tour guide in a museum, cathedral, or some such place of cultural interest.<br>N.B. Avoid the phrase docent guide, which is redundant.<br>Corresponding noun: docility.<br>Pronunciation tip: The pronunciation DOH-syl is the preference of British and Canadian speakers. The preferred American pronunciation is DAHS'l (rhymes with fossil)."
Redoubtable,[ri-DOW-tuh-buul],"Formidable, fearsome, arousing awe or dread; hence, worthy of or commanding respect.<br>Redoubtable comes through Middle English from an Old French verb meaning to fear or dread, and ultimately from the Latin dubitare, to doubt, waver in opinion or action, the source also of the words dubious, which means doubtful or questionable, and dubiety (d(y)oo-BY-i-tee), which means doubtfulness, uncertainty, wavering.<br>Perhaps because the things we find dubious or that make us waver are often the same things we find disturbing or frightening, redoubtable has come to apply to that which we fear and respect because we doubt our ability to match, oppose, or overcome it. In modern usage, redoubtable means fearsome, formidable (stress on for-, remember?), commanding respect, and may apply either to people or to things.<br>We speak of the legendary Hercules as a redoubtable hero; of drug abuse as a redoubtable social problem; of AIDS as a redoubtable disease; of the redoubtable genius of Albert Einstein; of a rivalry between two redoubtable football teams; or of small airline companies facing redoubtable competition from the big carriers.<br>In current usage redoubtable sometimes is used to achieve a humorous, gently mocking effect. For example, back when Johnny Carson was host of ""The Tonight Show,"" on which the actress Shelley Winters was a frequent guest, I remember Carson once cut to a commercial with this quip: ""Don't go away, because we'll be right back with the redoubtable Shelley Winters.""<br><br>Formidable, fearsome, arousing awe or dread; hence, worthy of or commanding respect.<br>Etymology and related words: Middle English, through an Old French verb meaning to fear or dread, ultimately from the Latin dubitare, to doubt, waver in opinion or action, the source also of the words dubious and dubiety, doubtfulness, uncertainty, wavering.<br>Usage: Redoubtable may apply to people or things, as a redoubtable hero or a redoubtable problem. The word is sometimes used to achieve a humorous, gently mocking effect."
Prognosticate,[prahg-NAHS-ti-kayt],"To predict; especially, to predict from signs, symptoms, or present indications.<br>Synonyms of prognosticate include foretell, forecast, foresee, prophesy (PRAHF-i-SY), presage (pri-SAYJ), and vaticinate (va-TIS-i-NAYT).<br>Prognosticate comes through Latin from Greek, and by derivation means ""a knowing beforehand, foreknowledge."" From the same source we inherit several related words.<br>Prognostic (prahg-NAHS-tik), used as a noun, means an indication of something in the future. Used as an adjective, prognostic means pertaining to or serving as the basis of a prediction, as prognostic powers or prognostic evidence.<br>The noun prognostication (prahg-NAHS-ti-KAY-shin) means a prediction, prophecy, forecast, as the prognostications of economists are not always reliable.<br>Prognosticator (prahg-NAHS-ti-KAY-tur) is a lofty word for ""a person who makes predictions."" If you want to be grandiloquent, you could say the reporter who does your local weather forecast is a prognosticator, or that a coworker who is always making predictions about affairs in the office is the office prognosticator.<br>Finally, the useful noun prognosis (prahg-NOH-sis) means a prediction of the probable course and outcome of a disease or medical condition.<br>Prognosis and diagnosis should be sharply distinguished. A diagnosis is an assessment of a medical condition. When you ask your doctor, ""What's the diagnosis?"" you are asking for the doctor's opinion of what is wrong based on a clinical analysis of signs and symptoms. When you ask your doctor, ""What's the prognosis?"" you are asking the doctor to predict the likely course and outcome of the condition based on whatever treatment is administered—in other words, to tell you whether the problem will get better or worse. In short, a diagnosis describes the nature of the medical condition; a prognosis predicts its likely course and outcome.<br>Our keyword, prognosticate, means to make a prognosis or prediction. Prognosticate applies especially to the act of predicting from signs, symptoms, or present indications. Political pundits attempt to prognosticate the outcome of an election. Financial analysts prognosticate trends in the stock market. Your horoscope in the newspaper purports to prognosticate from the alignment of the planets what may lie in store for you that day.<br>To predict; especially, to predict from signs, symptoms, or present indications.<br>Synonyms: foretell, forecast, foresee, prophesy, presage, vaticinate.<br>Related words: prognostic (noun), an indication of something in the future; prognostic (adjective), pertaining to or serving as the basis of a prediction (prognostic powers, prognostic evidence); prognostication, a prediction, prophecy, forecast (economic prognostications); prognosticator, a person who makes predictions; prognosis, a prediction of the probable course and outcome of a disease or medical condition.<br>N.B. Take care to distinguish the words prognosis and diagnosis. A diagnosis describes the nature of the medical condition; a prognosis predicts its likely course and outcome."
Engender,[en-JEN-dur],"To bring about, bring into being, give rise to, cause to exist, sow the seeds of.<br>Synonyms of engender include produce and generate. Antonyms include prevent, suppress, subdue, quell, and quash (rhymes with squash).<br>Engender comes through Middle English and Old French from the Latin generare, to beget, produce, bring to life. Originally, engender meant to beget by procreation, which is a fancy way of saying sexual intercourse. (And who told you Verbal Advantage wasn't a sexy program?) Dictionaries still list beget, procreate, and propagate as synonyms of engender, but the sense of breeding offspring has fallen by the wayside, and since at least Shakespeare's day engender has meant to bring forth, give rise to, cause to exist. A rally in the stock market may engender hope among investors that the economy is improving. An exchange of invective between nations can engender war.<br><br>To bring about, bring into being, give rise to, cause to exist, sow the seeds of.<br>Synonyms: produce, generate.<br>Antonyms: prevent, suppress, subdue, quell, quash.<br>Etymology: Latin generare, to beget, produce, bring to life.<br>Additional useful word: procreation, sexual intercourse, especially when it results in the creation of offspring."
Fetid,[FET-id],"Stinking, foul-smelling; having an extremely offensive odor, as of something rotten or decayed.<br>In Hamlet, Shakespeare could just as well have written ""Something is fetid in the state of Denmark,"" except that if he had, probably no one would quote the line today.<br>Challenging synonyms of fetid include rank, rancid, malodorous, putrid (PYOO-trid), noisome (NOY-sum), mephitic (me-FIT-ik), and graveolent (gruh-VEE-uh-lint). Antonyms include fragrant, scented, perfumed, aromatic, and redolent (RED-uh-lint).<br>Fetid comes through the Latin fetidus, which means ""stinking,"" from the verb fetere, to stink, have a bad smell. In current usage, fetid is not used of any old bad smell but is usually reserved for an extremely offensive odor, such as that produced by rotting or decay. For example, bad breath makes you wrinkle your nose; fetid breath makes you gag. When your garbage is odorous, it smells; when it's malodorous, it smells bad; when it's rank, it's really going sour; and when it's fetid, you’d better get rid of it before your neighbors call the health department.<br>And now, because I can read your twisted, puerile mind and I know you are waiting for me to get to this: yes, it's also true that a fart (which in this dignified program—stop giggling now!—we call ""a gaseous flatus expelled from the anus"") can also be fetid, foul-smelling.<br>I shall end this malodorous lesson with a pronunciation tip. You may occasionally see our keyword spelled foetid, and you may occasionally hear it pronounced FEE-tid. That's the British spelling and pronunciation. In American English we spell it fetid and prefer a short e: FET-id.<br><br>Stinking, foul-smelling; having an extremely offensive odor, as of something rotten or decayed.<br>Synonyms: rank, rancid, malodorous, putrid, noisome, mephitic, graveolent.<br>Antonyms: fragrant, scented, perfumed, aromatic, redolent.<br>Etymology: Latin fetidus, stinking, from fetere, to stink.<br>Usage: Fetid is usually reserved for an extremely offensive odor, such as that produced by rotting or decay.<br>Spelling and pronunciation tip: The spelling foetid and the pronunciation FEE-tid are British; If you're American, spell it fetid and pronounce, it with a short E: FET-id."
Pedantic,[pe-DAN-tik],"Absurdly learned; scholarly in an ostentatious way; making an inappropriate or tiresome display of knowledge by placing undue importance on trivial details, rules, or formalities.<br>After that definition, you're probably thinking that your guide through Verbal Advantage sometimes is pedantic about language. All right, it's true. As we pedantic types like to say, mea culpa (MAY-uh KUUL-puh), which is Latin for ""my fault."" On the other hand, I am also erudite, which as you learned in Level 3 means scholarly, possessing extensive knowledge acquired chiefly from books. That's not such a bad combination for someone whose job is to help you navigate the stormy sea of English words.<br>So, my verbally advantaged friend, if you want to emulate my grandiloquent erudition, then please pardon my pedantry as I explain that the adjective pedantic, and the corresponding nouns pedant (PED-’nt) and pedantry (PED-’n-tree), come through Italian and Latin from the Greek paidagogos, a tutor of children, the source also of the word pedagogue ( PED-uh-GAHG), which may mean simply a teacher, or a teacher who is narrow-minded, dogmatic, and—you guessed it—pedantic.<br>If we further break down the Greek paidagogos, we see that it is composed of pais, paidos, a boy or child, and agein, to lead or conduct, and means literally a leader or conductor of youngsters. For the significance of that derivation, let's turn to the erudite and only occasionally pedantic Century Dictionary (1914). ""Among the ancient Greeks and Romans,"" says the Century, ""the pedagogue was originally a slave who attended the younger children of his master, and conducted them to school, to the theater, etc., combining in many cases instruction with guardianship.""<br>This servile tutor of classical antiquity eventually rose to become the modern pedagogue, a teacher or schoolmaster, but a stigma of pedantry— meaning a slavish or dogmatic attention to rules and minor details of learning—remained on the word. Perhaps that explains why, when certain members of the teaching profession went looking for a more dignified word for themselves than teacher, they eschewed pedagogue and settled on three terms: educator, which is a good alternative; educationist, which is a pompous one; and educationalist, which is preposterous. But unless you happen to be a pedagogue, that's neither here nor there, and being the verbose pedant that I am, I digress.<br>A pedant was originally a pedagogue or teacher, but that sense soon fell into disuse and a pedant became, as the Century Dictionary puts it, ""a person who overrates erudition, or lays an undue stress on exact knowledge of detail or of trifles, as compared with larger matters or with general principles."" The noun pedantry refers to the manners or actions of a pedant. According to the eighteenth-century Irish essayist and dramatist Sir Richard Steele, ""Pedantry proceeds from much reading and little understanding."" Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels, defined pedantry as ""the overrating of any kind of knowledge we pretend to."" And the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (KOHL-rij, two syllables) wrote that ""pedantry consists in the use of words unsuitable to the time, place, and company.""<br>The adjective pedantic means absurdly learned; scholarly in an ostentatious way; making an inappropriate or tiresome display of knowledge by placing undue importance on trivial details, rules, or formalities.<br><br>Absurdly learned; scholarly in an ostentatious way; making an inappropriate or tiresome display of knowledge by placing undue importance on trivial details, rules, or formalities.<br>Useful phrase noted: mea culpa, (Latin) ""my fault""; pronounced MAY-uh KUUL-puh.<br>Corresponding nouns: pedant, a person who overrates learning, makes an inappropriate display of knowledge, or lays undue stress on trivial points or on exact knowledge of detail; pedantry, an inappropriate display of learning or a slavish or dogmatic attention to rules and minor details of learning.<br>Etymology and related word: Italian, through Latin, from the Greek paidagogos, a tutor of children, the source also of the word pedagogue, which may mean simply a teacher, or a teacher who is narrow-minded, dogmatic, and pedantic. The Greek paidagogos comes from pais, paidos, a boy or child, and agein, to lead or conduct, and means literally a leader or conductor of youngsters. ""Among the ancient Greeks and Romans,"" says the Century Dictionary, ""the pedagogue was originally a slave who attended the younger children of his master, and conducted them to school, to the theater, etc., combining in many cases instruction with guardianship."""
Capitulate,[kuh-PICH-uh-layt],"To yield, surrender; specifically, to surrender on specified terms or conditions.<br>The verbs to capitulate and to decapitate both come ultimately from the Latin caput, capitis, which means ""the head."" Decapitate sticks literally to its root and means to cut off the head. Capitulate has sprouted from its root and means to list the terms of surrender under various headings in a document.<br>Although some current dictionaries define capitulate as ""to surrender unconditionally or on stipulated terms,"" in precise usage capitulate means to yield or surrender only on stipulated terms, although the terms do not necessarily have to be drawn up in a document.<br>When armies or nations capitulate, they specify the conditions under which they will surrender. When people accused of a crime accept a plea bargain, they capitulate by stipulating the terms under which they will yield to the prosecution and accept a conviction. And when two parties come to terms in a dispute, you can be sure that one party is the victor and the other has capitulated.<br>The corresponding noun is capitulation, the act of surrendering or yielding on specified terms or conditions.<br><br>To yield, surrender; specifically, to surrender on specified terms or conditions.<br>Corresponding noun: capitulation, the act of surrendering or yielding on specified terms or conditions.<br>Etymology, related word, and usage: Latin caput, capitis, the head, the source also of decapitate. By derivation capitulate means to list the terms of surrender under various headings in a document; although some current dictionaries define capitulate as ""to surrender unconditionally or on stipulated terms,"" in precise usage capitulate means to yield or surrender only on stipulated terms, although the terms do not necessarily have to be drawn up in a document.<br>"
Inchoate,[in-KOH-it],"Just begun; in an early stage of development; partly in existence; not fully formed; undeveloped; imperfect; incomplete.<br>Synonyms of inchoate include elementary, preliminary, nascent (word 22 of this level), rudimentary, and incipient (in-SIP-ee-int).<br>Inchoate comes from the Latin incohatus, just begun, not finished, incomplete; incohatus is the past participle of the verb incohare, to begin, take in hand, start work on.<br>Since the sixteenth century, when inchoate entered English, the word has been used of that which has just begun or is in an early stage of development, and which is therefore imperfect or incomplete. An inchoate state is an initial, undeveloped state; an inchoate idea is an idea not yet fully formed; an inchoate project is a project that is just getting off the ground.<br><br>Just begun; in an early stage of development; partly in existence; not fully formed; undeveloped; imperfect; incomplete.<br>Synonyms: elementary, preliminary, nascent (Level 7, Word 22), rudimentary, incipient.<br>Etymology: Latin incohatus, just begun, not finished, incomplete, the past participle of the verb incohare, to begin, take in hand, start work on."
Exponent,[eks-POH-nint],"A person who stands or speaks for something, a representative or advocate.<br>Exponent comes from the Latin exponere, to put forth, put on view, display. The Latin exponere is also the source of the English verb to expound, which means to explain, interpret, set forth point by point, as to expound an idea or to expound the principles of business management. An exponent may be a person who expounds, an explainer, interpreter, or commentator, but in current usage exponent more often applies to a person who stands or speaks for something, someone who represents, advocates, or promotes some idea or purpose: The leader of a political party is the exponent of its principles and goals; the pontiff is the exponent of Roman Catholicism; the framers of the U.S. Constitution were exponents of democracy and individual liberty; and Carry Nation, the austere and abstemious nineteenth-century temperance crusader who chopped up saloons with a hatchet, was a radical exponent of abstinence from alcoholic beverages.<br><br>A person who stands or speaks for something, a representative or advocate.<br>Etymology and related word: Latin exponere, to put forth, put on view, display, the source also of the English verb to expound, to explain, interpret, set forth point by point."
Mendacious,[men-DAY-shus],"Not truthful, lying, false, dishonest, deceitful.<br>Mendacious comes through the Latin mendacium, a lie, from the adjective mendax, which means lying, deceitful. By derivation mendacious means given to lying, disposed to falsehood or deceit. A mendacious person is a dishonest person, one who is prone to lie or deceive; a mendacious statement is an untruthful statement, a deliberate falsehood or a lie.<br>Synonyms of mendacious include fraudulent, hypocritical, disingenuous (DIS-in-JEN-yoo-us), evasive, equivocal (i-KWIV-uh-kul), duplicitous (d(y)oo-PLIS-i-tus), and prevaricating (pri-VAR-i-KAY-ting).<br>Antonyms include truthful, honorable, upright, ethical, virtuous, scrupulous, and veracious (ve-RAY-shus). The corresponding noun is mendacity (men-DAS-i-tee), untruthfulness, lying, deceit.<br><br>Not truthful, lying, false, dishonest, deceitful.<br>Etymology: Latin mendacium, a lie, from mendax, lying, deceitful.<br>Synonyms: fraudulent, hypocritical, disingenuous, evasive, equivocal, duplicitous, prevaricating.<br>Antonyms: truthful, honorable, upright, ethical, virtuous, scrupulous, veracious.<br>Corresponding noun: mendacity, untruthfulness, lying, deceit."
Strident,[STRY-dint],"Loud and harsh-sounding, grating, shrill.<br>Synonyms of strident include earsplitting, screeching, discordant, clamorous, cacophonous (kuh-KAHF-uh-nus), vociferous (voh-SIF-ur-us), and stentorian (sten-TOR-ee-in).<br>Antonyms include faint, subdued, melodious, dulcet (DUHL-sit), and euphonious (yoo-FOH-nee-us).<br>Strident comes from the present participle of the Latin verb stridere, to make a harsh noise. Apparently, stridere was a versatile word in Latin, for ancient Roman poets and writers such as Vergil (VUR-jil), Lucretius (loo-KREE-shus), and Ovid (AH-vid) used it to describe many sounds, not all of them harsh: the grating of metal on metal; the whistling of the wind; the scraping or whining of a saw; the creaking of a wagon, a rope, or a hinge on a door; the whirring of a rock or an arrow propelled through the air; the braying of an ass; the trumpeting of elephants; the grunting of a pig; the hiss of a snake; and even the humming of bees.<br>The words that English has inherited from the Latin stridere are not so versatile, and stick more closely to the core meaning of this ancient verb: to make a harsh noise. For instance, the noun stridor (STRY-dur) may mean a harsh grating or creaking sound or, in medicine, a harsh sound made when breathing in or out that indicates obstruction of the respiratory tract. The adjective stridulous (STRIJ-uh-lus) means making a harsh or shrill noise. And the verb to stridulate (STRIJ-uh-LAYT) means to make a shrill, high-pitched grating or chirping sound. Crickets and various other insects stridulate by rubbing certain body parts together.<br>Our keyword, strident, applies to any sound or noise that is disagreeably loud, harsh, and shrill: a piercing scream, the screeching of brakes, the grinding of gears, the whining of a power tool, the wailing of a baby, or any loud, gruff voice that grates on your ears can be described as strident.<br><br>Loud and harsh-sounding, grating, shrill.<br>Synonyms: earsplitting, screeching, discordant, clamorous, cacophonous, vociferous, stentorian.<br>Antonyms: faint, subdued, melodious, dulcet, euphonious.<br>Etymology and related words: Latin stridere, to make a harsh noise. From stridere, English has also inherited stridor (STRY-dur), a harsh grating or creaking sound or, in medicine, a harsh sound made when breathing in or out that indicates obstruction of the respiratory tract; stridulous (STRIJ-uh-lus), making a harsh or shrill noise; and stridulate (STRIJ-uh-layt), to make a shrill, high-pitched grating or chirping sound (like a cricket)."
Oligarchy,[AHL-uh-GAHR-kee],"Government by a few; rule or control exercised by a few persons or by a small, elite group.<br>Oligarchy comes from the Greek oligos, few, little, and archein, to govern, rule, and by derivation means ""government by the few."" Oligarchy may denote rule or control exercised by a few people, a state or an organization run by a few people, or the few dominant people themselves, and the word often suggests the hoarding of power for corrupt or selfish purposes. Thus we speak of an oligarchy within organized crime; an oligarchy of the rich; or the oligarchy of the former Soviet Union.<br>For the corresponding adjective, both oligarchic and oligarchical are acceptable.<br>Here's a pronunciation tip: You may hear some speakers pronounce oligarchy with a long o: OH-ligarchy. This recent variant is listed second in two current dictionaries; all other authorities, past and present, do not recognize it.

Refulgent,[ri-FUHL-jent],"Shining brightly, brilliant, radiant, resplendent.<br>Additional synonyms of refulgent include gleaming, blazing, sparkling, luminous, incandescent, scintillating, and coruscating. In case you're wondering about those last three, allow me to explain.<br>Incandescent (IN-kan-DES-int) means extremely bright or glowing with heat. It may sound peculiar to say so, but a light bulb, a person's mind, and a spiritual truth all can be described as incandescent. Scintillating (SIN -ti-LAY-ting) means throwing off sparks, sparkling or twinkling. You can have scintillating thoughts, scintillating conversation, or observe scintillating stars in the summer sky. Coruscating (KOR-uh-SKAY-ting or KAHR-) means giving off flashes of light, flashing or glittering. An impressive display of fireworks is a coruscating display; a flashy or brilliant performance can be described as a coruscating performance.<br>Antonyms of refulgent include dull, dim, obscure, gloomy, and murky, all of which I know you know, so I think I'll commit an unpardonable act of pedantic obfuscation by muddling and bewildering you with these mind-boggling antonyms: tenebrous (TEN-uh-brus), which means dark and gloomy; umbrageous (uhm-BRAY-jus), which means shady or overshadowed; subfuscous (suhb-FUHS-kus), which means dusky or somber; and—do you have room upstairs for one more?—crepuscular (kri-PUHS-kyuh-lur), which means pertaining to twilight, hence, characterized by dim, waning, or glimmering light.<br>Our brilliant keyword, refulgent, comes from the present participle of the Latin verb refulgere, to shine brightly, which comes in turn from re-, meaning ""back,"" and fulgere, to shine, flash, or gleam. You may use refulgent literally to mean gleaming or shining brightly; for example, someone can give you a refulgent smile, or you can explore a cave with the refulgent beam of a powerful flashlight. You may also use refulgent to mean figuratively brilliant or radiant; for example, you may know someone with a refulgent wit, or a person of refulgent beauty.<br>The corresponding noun is refulgence (ri-FUHL-jents), brilliance, radiance, resplendence.<br>Shining brightly, brilliant, radiant, resplendent.<br>Synonyms: gleaming, blazing, sparkling, luminous, incandescent, scintillating, coruscating. (The discussion defines and distinguishes the last three synonyms.)<br>Antonyms: (easy) dull, dim, obscure, gloomy, murky; (hard) tenebrous, dark and gloomy; umbrageous, shady or overshadowed; subfuscous, dusky or somber; crepuscular, pertaining to twilight, hence, characterized by dim, waning, or glimmering light.<br>Etymology: Latin refulgere, to shine brightly, from re-, back, and fulgere, to shine, flash, or gleam.<br>Usage: Refulgent may mean shining, brilliant, radiant, either literally (a refulgent smile, the refulgent beam of a flashlight) or figuratively (a refulgent wit, refulgent beauty).<br>Corresponding noun: refulgence, brilliance, radiance, resplendence."
Nepotism,[NEP-uh-tiz-'m],"Favoritism shown to relatives.<br>Nepotism comes through French and Italian from the Latin nepos, nepotis, a nephew or grandson. According to the Century Dictionary (1914), ""the word was invented [in the seventeenth century] to characterize a propensity of the popes and other high ecclesiastics in the Roman Catholic Church to aggrandize their family by exorbitant grants or favors to nephews or relatives.""<br>In current usage nepotism denotes favoritism shown to any relative, and the word usually applies to situations in business and public life where relatives are shown preference over nonrelatives and receive privileges or positions that they may not necessarily deserve. Thus, if you give your niece money to help her buy a house or persuade a friend to hire your unemployed brother, it's not nepotism. However, when you hire your brother the bricklayer as vice president of your sporting goods company, and when you give your niece—the high-school dropout who can't type—a secretarial job and six months later promote her to office manager, those are flagrant acts of nepotism.<br>The corresponding adjective is nepotistic (NEP-uh-TIS-tik).<br><br>Favoritism shown to relatives.<br>Etymology: Latin nepos, nepotis, a nephew or grandson.<br>Usage: Despite its specific derivation, nepotism may denote favoritism shown to any relative, and the word usually applies to situations in business and public life where relatives are shown preference over ""non-relatives"" and receive privileges or positions that they may not necessarily deserve. Corresponding adjective: nepotistic."
Ribald,[RIB-uld],"Humorous in a mildly indecent, coarse, or vulgar way.<br>Here's what three leading American dictionaries have to say about our humorously indecent keyword: The third edition of The American Heritage Dictionary (1992) says that ribald implies ""vulgar, coarse, off-color language or behavior that provokes mirth."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, tenth edition (1998), says that ribald ""applies to what is amusingly or picturesquely vulgar or irreverent or mildly indecent."" And Webster's New World Dictionary, third college edition (1997), says that ribald suggests ""mild indecency or lewdness as might bring laughter from those who are not too squeamish,"" and refers especially to that which deals with sex ""in a humorously earthy or direct way.""<br>Ribald has an appropriately earthy etymology. It comes from an Old French noun meaning a lewd or wanton person; this wanton noun comes in turn from an Old French verb meaning to be sexually abandoned; and this loose verb is related to an Old High German word that meant figuratively to copulate and literally to rub. Although Hamlet's oft-quoted line ""Ay, there's the rub"" is not a reference to his ribald fantasies about Ophelia, many of Shakespeare's plays contain ribald jokes and puns whose mildly coarse and indecent sexual overtones have provoked laughter from audiences for more than four hundred years.<br>Synonyms of ribald include gross, indelicate, lewd, immodest, sensual, and obscene. Bear in mind, however, that obscene suggests lewdness or indecency that is strongly offensive, whereas ribald applies to coarse vulgarity that is humorous and only mildly indecent.<br>Antonyms of ribald include refined, decent, polite, tasteful, cultured, polished, cultivated, decorous (DEK-ur-us), and urbane (ur-BAYN).<br>The corresponding noun is ribaldry, which means language or behavior that is humorous in a mildly indecent or vulgar way.<br>Let me conclude this discussion with a pronunciation tip: Some speakers have adopted the indelicate spelling pronunciation RY-bawld, and certain dictionaries that cater to the gross whims of the vulgar masses now record RY-bawld. I urge you to eschew this unrefined variant, and also to avoid the equally uncultivated RIB-awld. There is no rye and there is no bald in ribald . The word should rhyme with scribbled and dribbled.<br>And speaking of rhyme, for your verbal advantage, edification, and delight, I have composed a ribald limerick to help you remember the proper pronunciation of the word:<br>William Shakespeare, whenever he scribbled,<br>Used a quill that incessantly dribbled;<br>When his pen leaked a lot,<br>It made Willy quite hot,<br>And he wrote something suitably ribald.<br><br>Humorous in a mildly indecent, coarse, or vulgar way.<br>Synonyms: gross, indelicate, lewd, immodest, sensual, obscene.<br>N.B. Obscene suggests lewdness or indecency that is strongly offensive, whereas ribald applies to coarse vulgarity that is humorous and only mildly indecent.<br>Antonyms: refined, decent, polite, tasteful, cultured, polished, cultivated, decorous, urbane (Level 1, Word 45).<br>Corresponding noun: ribaldry, language or behavior that is humorous in a mildly indecent or vulgar way.<br>Pronunciation tip: Certain dictionaries that cater to the gross whims of the vulgar masses now record the indelicate spelling pronunciation RY-bald and the equally uncultivated RIB-ald. There is no rye and there is no bald in ribald. The word should rhyme with scribbled and dribbled, as this limerick illustrates:<br>William Shakespeare, whenever he scribbled;<br>Used a quill that incessantly dribbled;<br>When his pen leaked a lot,  It made Willy quite hot,<br>And he wrote something suitably ribald."
Avuncular,[uh-VUHNGK-yuh-lur],"Like an uncle, pertaining to an uncle, or exhibiting some characteristic considered typical of an uncle.<br>The noun uncle and the adjective avuncular both come from the Latin avunculus, a mother's brother. You may use avuncular to describe some characteristic of your own or someone else's uncle, but the word most often applies to anything suggestive or typical of an uncle. We speak of an avuncular smile, an avuncular slap on the back, avuncular concern, avuncular generosity, and avuncular advice. ""I want you for the U.S. Army"" is the finger-pointing, avuncular injunction of Uncle Sam. <br>Like an uncle, pertaining to an uncle, or exhibiting some characteristic considered typical of an uncle (an avuncular smile, an avuncular slap on the back, avuncular concern, avuncular generosity, avuncular advice).<br>Etymology: The noun uncle and the adjective avuncular both come from the Latin avunculus, a mother's brother."
Supplicate,[SUHP-li-kayt],"To ask, beg, or plead for humbly and earnestly.<br>Synonyms of supplicate include entreat, petition, importune, and beseech.<br>The verb to supplicate comes from the Latin supplicare, to kneel, get on one's knees, which in turn comes from supplex, kneeling, on one's knees. By derivation, to supplicate means to beg or plead for something on bended knee. From the same source we also inherit the word supple (SUHP-’l). Occasionally supple is used to mean yielding, compliant, or obsequious, but it is now most often used either literally or figuratively to mean bending easily, limber, flexible, as a supple bough or a supple mind.<br>The corresponding noun supplication (SUHP-li-KAY-shin) means either a humble and earnest request or the act of begging or pleading for something humbly and earnestly. A person who supplicates or who makes a supplication may be called either a suppliant (SUHP-lee-int) or a supplicant (SUHP-li-kint).<br><br>To ask, beg, or plead for humbly and earnestly.<br>Synonyms: entreat, petition, importune, beseech.<br>Etymology and related word: Latin supplicare, to kneel, get on one's knees, from supplex, kneeling, on one's knees. By derivation, to supplicate means to beg or plead for something on bended knee. From the same source comes supple, bending easily.<br>Corresponding nouns: supplication, a humble and earnest request or the act of begging or pleading for something humbly and earnestly. A person who supplicates or who makes a supplication may be called either a suppliant or a supplicant."
Irascible,[i-RAS-i-buul or eye-RAS-i-buul],"Easily angered, hot-tempered, extremely irritable or touchy.<br>Synonyms of irascible include cranky, testy, peevish, petulant (PECH-uh-lint), irate, cantankerous (kan-TANGK-uh-rus), contentious (word 16 of Level 7), snappish, choleric (KAHL-ur-ik), captious (KAP-shus), and splenetic (spli-NET-ik).<br>Antonyms include calm, unruffled, placid, amiable, affable, and equable (EK-wuh-buul).<br>Irascible and irate (eye-RAYT) both come from the Latin verb irasci, to be angry, which comes in turn from ira, anger, wrath. This Latin ira is also the direct source of the English word ire (like tire without the t).<br>A person who is full of ire, anger, may be either irate or irascible. Webster's New International Dictionary, second edition (1934), explains that an irate person ""is at the moment angry or incensed""; an irascible person ""is by temperament prone to anger."" Thus, when something infuriates you, you are seized by ire, anger, and you become irate, temporarily enraged. However, if ire burns within you constantly, if you are by nature easily provoked to anger, then you are irascible. Irascible may also apply to that which displays anger or extreme irritability:<br>""Steve put up with Randy's incessant stream of irascible remarks for as long as he could, but eventually enough was enough, and he became irate.""<br><br>Easily angered, hot-tempered, extremely irritable or touchy.<br>Synonyms: cranky, testy, peevish, petulant, irate, cantankerous, contentious (Level 7, Word 16), snappish, choleric, captious, splenetic.<br>Antonyms: calm, unruffled, placid, amiable, affable, equable<br>Etymology and related words: The words irascible and irate both come from the Latin verb irasci, to be angry, which comes in turn from ira, anger, wrath. This Latin ira is also the direct source of the English word ire, anger, wrath.<br>N.B. Irate suggests temporary anger, the state of being infuriated or enraged at the moment or for the time being. Irascible suggests extreme irritability, and applies to a person easily provoked to anger. Irascible may also apply to that which displays anger or extreme irritability: irascible remarks."
Inexorable,[in-EK-sur-uh-buul],"Relentless, unyielding, merciless; not able to be stopped, changed, or moved by entreaty or persuasion.<br>Synonyms of inexorable include unrelenting, unswerving, inflexible, immovable, uncompromising, intransigent (in-TRAN-si-jent, word 4 of Level 8), obdurate (AHB-d(y)uu-rit), and implacable (im-PLAK-uh-buul).<br>Antonyms include flexible, compromising, obliging, compliant, docile (word 28 of this level), tractable, acquiescent (AK-wee-ES-int), and complaisant (kum-PLAY-zint).<br>Inexorable comes from the Latin adjective inexorabilis, not moved by entreaty or supplication. By derivation inexorable means not responsive to earnest pleas or humble prayers, and therefore relentless, unyielding.<br>Inexorable and implacable are close in meaning. Implacable is the stronger of the two; it applies to feeling, and means incapable of being pacified or appeased. An irascible person might express implacable hatred or implacable resentment. Inexorable means incapable of being moved or changed by petition or persuasion, deaf to all pleas.<br>According to the Century Dictionary (1914), inexorable ""expresses an immovable firmness in refusing to do what one is entreated to do, whether that be good or bad."" It may apply to a person: ""Joe pleaded with his manager to give him an extra day of vacation, but his manager was inexorable."" It may also apply to a thing, as ""an inexorable campaign to squash the competition and dominate the industry."" It may also be used figuratively, as ""The inexorable hand of fate, the inexorable voice of necessity, the inexorable drifting of the sands of time, and the inexorable winds of war all led him to his inexorable doom."" And in my ability to produce clichés to illustrate this word, I am also inexorable, relentless, unyielding, merciless.<br><br>Relentless, unyielding, merciless; not able to be stopped, changed, or moved by entreaty or persuasion.<br>Synonyms: unrelenting, unswerving, inflexible, immovable, uncompromising, intransigent, obdurate, implacable.<br>Antonyms: flexible, compromising, obliging, compliant, docile (Level 7, Word 28), tractable, acquiescent, complaisant (kum-PLAY-zint).<br>Etymology: Latin inexorabilis, not moved by entreaty or supplication.<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes the words inexorable and implacable."
Parvenu,[PAHR-vuh-n(y)oo],"An upstart; specifically, a person who suddenly acquires wealth and power and rises to a higher class, but who is not accepted by the members of that class.<br>Parvenu comes from a French verb meaning to succeed, and means literally ""a person newly come into success."" Parvenu almost always is used in a negative sense of a person who gains wealth and standing, but who cannot gain the social acceptance of the wealthy and powerful. In the eyes of the established elite, the parvenu is an upstart—undeserving, uncultured, immodest, and often pretentious.<br>Those masters of the fine art of condescenscion, the French, have condescended to give English another useful term for this sort of person: arriviste (AR-ee-VEEST). As you may have deduced from that spelling, arriviste means literally ""a person who has recently arrived."" The word crossed the English Channel into the language about 1900, and is used today of someone who attains social prominence or a position of power sometimes by unscrupulous means and always without paying the necessary dues.<br>Both the parvenu and the arriviste are upstarts, but the difference between them is this: The parvenu usually acquires wealth and status by an accident of fate—for example, through an unexpected inheritance, a business windfall or promotion, or by cleaning up at Las Vegas. Once arrived, the parvenu makes an awkward or pretentious attempt to gain social acceptance from the members of the class into which he has risen. The arriviste, on the other hand, is a vulgar and often ruthless social climber who has clawed his way to the top and doesn't care what anyone thinks or says about it.<br><br>An upstart; specifically, a person who suddenly acquires wealth and power and rises to a higher class, but who is not accepted by the members of that class. Etymology: French; literally, ""a person newly come into success.""<br>Usage: Parvenu almost always is used in a negative sense of a person who gains wealth and standing, but who cannot gain the social acceptance of the wealthy and powerful. In the eyes of the established elite, the parvenu is an upstart-undeserving, uncultured, immodest, and often pretentious.<br>Related word: arriviste (ar-ree-VEEST). This word also comes from French and means literally ""a person who has recently arrived."" Arriviste is used today of someone who attains social prominence or a position of power, sometimes by unscrupulous means and always without paying the necessary dues.<br>N.B. This discussion concludes by distinguishing parvenu and arriviste."
Salubrious,[suh-LOO-bree-us],"Healthful, wholesome, favorable or conducive to well-being.<br>Antonyms of salubrious include insalubrious, deleterious (word 33 of Level 4), pernicious (word 10 of this level), noxious, baneful, malign, and noisome (NOY-sum).<br>Salubrious, salutary, and wholesome all mean good for your health. Wholesome refers to that which benefits or builds up the body, mind, or spirit, as a wholesome diet, wholesome recreation, or the wholesome effects of building your vocabulary. Salutary (SAL-yuh-TER-ee) refers to that which has, or is intended to have, a corrective or remedial effect upon the health or general condition of someone or something, as salutary advice or a salutary proposal to revitalize the inner city. Salubrious refers to that which is healthful, invigorating, or promotes physical well-being, as salubrious air, a salubrious climate, or salubrious exercise.<br>Both salutary and salubrious come from the Latin salus, health.

Hyperbole,[hy-PUR-buh-lee],"Exaggeration in speech or writing; especially, extravagant exaggeration that is intentional and obvious.<br>The corresponding adjective is hyperbolic (HY-pur-BAHL-ik), or, less often, hyperbolical (HY-pur-BAHL-ik-ul).<br>Occasionally, you will hear an educated speaker who has learned this word from reading, but who has not bothered to check its pronunciation in a dictionary, say hyperbowl. Any sports fan will tell you that there's a Super Bowl, a Sugar Bowl, a Cotton Bowl, and a Rose Bowl, but there is no Hyper Bowl. The only recognized pronunciation is hy-PUR-buh-lee, and anything else is downright beastly.<br>Hyperbole comes from a Greek word meaning an excess, something that overshoots the mark. This Greek word comes in turn from a verb meaning to exceed or throw beyond. By derivation, hyperbole is extravagant language that exceeds what is necessary or overshoots the mark.<br>As Bergen Evans explains in his Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage (1957), ""Hyperbole is the term in rhetoric for obvious exaggeration. There is no intent to deceive. The extravagant language is for emphasis only.""<br>Because hyperbole heightens the effect of what we say without obscuring its meaning, it's a popular rhetorical device, and many of the most shopworn expressions in the language are hyperbolic. Here are just a few examples of hackneyed hyperbole: I owe you a million thanks; she waited for an eternity; he was eternally grateful; we are forever indebted to you; I am so tired I could sleep for a week; they ran faster than lightning; he's as strong as an ox; your briefcase weighs a ton; my feet are killing me; he said he’d do it or die trying. These and many more hyperbolic expressions are acceptable in informal speech and excusable in the most casual forms of writing, but in situations that demand more formal and precise expression, or in which an exaggerated effect would be inappropriate, they should be scrupulously avoided.<br>Not all hyperbole is cliché. There are many memorable statements, withering insults, and powerful speeches that manifest an original, effective, and often striking use of hyperbole. In The Elements of Speechwriting and Public Speaking (1989), Jeff Scott Cook defines hyperbole as ""an exaggeration used to emphasize a point,"" and offers the following examples, among others:<br>Former Texas senator, vice-presidential candidate, and secretary of the treasury Lloyd Bentsen once said, ""The thrift industry is really in terrible shape. It's reached the point where if you buy a toaster, you get a free savings and loan.""<br>Faye Wattleton, former president of Planned Parenthood, once said, ""Those ‘just say no’ [to sex] messages are about as effective at preventing [teen] pregnancy as saying ‘have a nice day’ prevents chronic depression.""<br>And the actor Robert Redford once quipped hyperbolically, ""If you stay in<br>Beverly Hills too long, you become a Mercedes.""<br>Some of the finest English poetry ever written also makes stunning use of hyperbole. One of Shakespeare's most glorious and hyperbolic passages occurs in Antony and Cleopatra, when Enobarbus describes the wondrous, irresistible beauty of Cleopatra, who has sailed down the river Cydnus on an opulent barge. Here is a selection from that passage:<br>The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br>Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfum’ed that The winds were lovesick with them….<br>The city cast<br>Her people out upon her; and Antony,<br>Enthroned i’ th’ marketplace, did sit alone,<br>Whistling to th’ air; which, but for vacancy,<br>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And made a gap in nature.<br><br>Exaggeration in speech or writing; especially, extravagant exaggeration that is intentional and obvious.<br>Corresponding adjective: hyperbolic (HY-pur-BAHL-ik); less often, hyperbolical.<br>Pronunciation tip: Occasionally, you will hear an educated speaker who has learned this word from reading, but who has not bothered to check its pronunciation in a dictionary, say hyper-bowl. Hy-PUR-buh-lee is the only recognized pronunciation."
Sanctimonious,[SANGK-ti-MOH-nee-us],"Self-righteous; holier-than-thou; characterized by insincere or affected righteousness, virtuousness, or religious piety.<br>Sanctimonious comes from the Latin sanctus, holy, sacred, and the word was once used to mean holy or sacred. In modern usage, however, sanctimonious refers to insincere, affected, or hypocritical holiness or righteousness. People who are sanctimonious come off as self-righteous and holier-than-thou but do not practice what they preach.<br>The corresponding noun is sanctimony (SANGK-tuh-MOH-nee), righteousness or virtuousness that is affected or hypocritical.<br>Self-righteous; holier-than-thou; characterized by insincere or affected righteousness, virtuousness, or religious piety.<br>Etymology and usage: Latin sanctus, holy, sacred. In modern usage, sanctimonious refers to insincere, affected, or hypocritical holiness or righteousness.<br>Corresponding noun: sanctimony, righteousness or virtuousness that is affected or hypocritical."
