Jejune,[ji-JOON],"Dull, uninteresting, or unsatisfying; devoid of nourishment, substance, or significance.<br>Synonyms of jejune include flat, stale, arid, insipid, and vapid (word 37 of Level 8).<br>Jejune comes from the Latin jejunus, fasting, hungry, barren, dry. From the same source comes the anatomical term jejunum (ji-JOO-num), the middle section of the small intestine, between the duodenum and the ileum.<br>The jejunum took that name, the dictionaries tell us, because in postmortem dissections it was found barren of digestive contents and therefore believed to be empty after death.<br>The adjective jejune was once used to mean hungry, fasting, without food, but that sense is obsolete and in modern usage jejune is used figuratively to mean barren of interest, dull and unsatisfying, devoid of nourishment, substance, or significance. A jejune diet lacks nourishment; jejune food is tasteless and unsatisfying. A jejune idea or a jejune method lacks appeal because it is devoid of substance or significance. A jejune movie or jejune novel is dull, uninteresting, insipid.<br>If you look up jejune in a current dictionary, you will also see another definition of the word: youthful, childish, immature, puerile, as jejune behavior or a jejune response to a serious question. Whence comes this sense of the word, which is so clearly unconnected to the root meaning, barren of substance or appeal?<br>For an answer let's turn to William Safire, the language maven of The New York Times, who writes a column for that paper's Sunday magazine called ""On Language."" On October 16, 1994, Safire reported that he had queried Jacques Barzun, one of the world's foremost authorities on English usage, about this extended sense of the word, and the venerable professor responded that ""the meaning ‘youthful, childish’ for jejune"" had gotten into the dictionaries ""only as a concession to the misusers.""<br>According to Safire, ""the original meaning of jejune—‘empty of food, meager’—led to its modern sense of ‘dull, insipid.’ Probably because the word sounded like juvenile, it picked up a meaning of ‘puerile, childish,’ which,"" Safire asserts, ""is the way it is most commonly used today."" (Yet another example of the insidious sounds-like syndrome at work.)<br>Safire then poses the eternal question regarding capricious usage: ""Should we stand with the prescriptivists, as Barzun suggests, and hold fast to the ‘proper’ meaning? Or do we go along with the language slobs, adopting as ‘correct’ a mistake merely because it is so frequently made?""<br>Here's how Safire answers his own question: ""At a certain point, what people mean when they use a word becomes its meaning. We should resist its adoption, pointing out the error, for years; mockery helps; if the meaning persists, though, it is senseless to ignore the new sense. I say jejune means puerile now,"" Safire concludes.<br>I disagree with Mr. Safire, and stand with Mr. Barzun on the side of reserving jejune for the meaning ""devoid of nourishment, substance, or significance."" That is my crotchet, and I'm proud of it. However, although few people know the word jejune, I will concede that many of those who do now use it to mean childish or immature; and therefore, as Mr. Safire suggests, resistance to this change in meaning may now be effete, and further mockery of it may be jejune—which you may take as meaning either dull, insipid, or juvenile, immature.<br>Welcome to the war of words, my verbally advantaged friend. What will be your strategy for this controversial word jejune?<br><br>Dull, uninteresting, or unsatisfying; devoid of nourishment, substance, or significance.<br>Synonyms: flat, stale, arid, insipid, vapid (Level 8, Word 37).<br>Etymology and related word: Latin jejunus, fasting, hungry, barren, dry, the source also of jejunum, the middle section of the small intestine, between the duodenum and the ileum, believed to be empty after death.<br>Usage problem: If you look up jejune in a current dictionary, you will also see another definition of the word: youthful, childish, immature, puerile. This sense is objected to by certain usage experts who regard it as having developed through an erroneous analogy with the word juvenile.<br>According to Jacques Barzun, one of the world's foremost authorities on English usage, ""the meaning `youthful, childish' for jejune has got into the dictionaries only as a concession to the misusers.""<br>On the other hand, William Safire, the language maven of The New York Times, believes that ""childish, puerile"" is the sense in which jejune is most commonly used today. ""At a certain point, what people mean when they use a word becomes its meaning,"" writes Safire. ""We should resist its adoption, pointing out the error, for years; mockery helps; if the meaning persists, though, it is senseless to ignore the new sense."""
Paucity,[PAW-si-tee],"An insufficiency, scarcity, especially a serious or extreme one, a dire lack.<br>Synonyms of paucity include dearth (word 12 of Level 3), shortage, deficie ncy, and the challenging word exiguity (EK-si-GYOO-i-tee). The noun exiguity and the adjective exiguous (eg-ZIG-yoo-us or ek-SIG-yoo-us) come through the Latin exiguus, small, scanty, from exigere, to measure out, demand. Exiguous means extremely meager or scanty; an exiguity is an extremely small or scanty amount. Exiguity and paucity are close synonyms and are virtually interchangeable.<br>Paucity comes through the Latin paucitas, fewness, scarcity, from paucus, few. In modern usage, paucity may mean simply a scarcity or insufficiency, as a paucity of words, but it often suggests a serious or extreme insuffiency, a dire lack. We speak of a paucity of supplies; a paucity of information; a paucity of funds; a paucity of natural resources in the region; or a paucity of orders leading to the decision to take a product off the market.<br>Antonyms of paucity include superabundance, superfluity (SOO-purFLOO-i-tee), and plethora (word 19 of Level 6).<br><br>An insufficiency, scarcity, especially a serious or extreme one, a dire lack.<br>Synonyms: dearth (Level 3, Word 12), shortage, deficiency, exiguity (corresponding adjective: exiguous).<br>Antonyms: superabundance, superfluity, plethora.<br>Etymology: Latin paucitas, fewness, scarcity, from paucus, few."
Minatory,[MIN-uh-TOR-ee],"Threatening, menacing; having a threatening or menacing aspect or nature.<br>Minatory and the even more unusual adjective minacious (mi-NAY-shus) are synonymous and may be used interchangeably. Both words come from the same source—the Latin minari, to threaten—and are related to the word menace. Minatory clouds have a threatening aspect, indicating heavy rain or snow. Minatory people are menacing by nature. A minatory look is a menacing look. Minatory words are threatening words.<br><br>Threatening, menacing; having a threatening or menacing aspect or nature.<br>Synonym: minacious.<br>Etymology and related word: Minatory and minacious come from the Latin minari, to threaten and are related to the word menace."
Putative,[PYOO-tuh-tiv],"Supposed, reputed, commonly considered or regarded as such; deemed to be so but not proved.<br>Antonyms of putative include certain, definite, unquestionable, indisputable, indubitable, incontrovertible, and irrefragable (i-REF-ruh-guh-buul).<br>Putative comes from the Latin putare, to consider, believe, think, suppose. That which is putative is commonly thought to be so, generally considered true but not conclusively proved. We speak of someone's putative parents; the putative perpetrator of a crime; a putative leader or a person with putative authority, meaning the person believed to be in control; and a putative discovery, meaning a discovery generally attributed to someone without proof. We might also speak of Zsa Zsa Gabor's putative age, the age she is commonly thought to be—but who can say for sure?<br><br>Supposed, reputed, commonly considered or regarded as such; deemed to be so but not proved.<br>Antonyms: certain, definite, unquestionable, indisputable, indubitable, incontrovertible, irrefragable.<br>Etymology: Latin putare, to consider, believe, think, suppose."
Lucubration,[LOO-kyoo-BRAY-shin],"Nocturnal labor; study, writing, or work done late at night.<br>Lucubration comes from the Latin lucubrare, to work by candlelight. The corresponding adjective, lucubratory (LOO-kyoo-bruh-TOR-ee) means literally done by candlelight; hence, pertaining to nocturnal study or labor. The corresponding verb to lucubrate (LOO-kyoo-BRAYT) means to work, study, or write into the wee hours.<br>To use a vernacular expression, lucubration means burning the midnight oil. College students often engage in lucubration, and meeting a deadline for an important project may require an eleventh-hour bout of diligent lucubration.<br>In current usage, the verb to lucubrate may also be used to mean to compose with laborious effort, and especially to write in a scholarly or pedantic fashion, as a professor of political science who lucubrates abstrusely from her ivory tower. The noun lucubration has also come to be used of anything produced by laborious study or effort, especially an elaborate, pedantic, or pretentious piece of writing.<br><br>Nocturnal labor; study, writing, or work done late at night.<br>Etymology: Latin lucubrate, to work by candlelight.<br>Corresponding adjective: lucubratory, literally ""done by candlelight""; hence, pertaining to nocturnal study or labor.<br>Corresponding verb: lucubrate, to work, study, or write into the wee hours.<br>Usage: Lucubrate may also mean to compose with laborious effort, and especially to write in a scholarly or pedantic fashion; lucubration has also come to mean anything produced by laborious study or effort, especially an elaborate, pedantic, or pretentious piece of writing."
Troglodyte,[TRAHG-luh-DYT],"A cave dweller; also, a person who lives or behaves in a primitive manner, or who lives in seclusion. The corresponding adjective is troglodytic (TRAHG-luh-DIT-ik), pertaining to or characteristic of a troglodyte.<br>Troglodyte comes from a Greek word meaning ""one who creeps into holes."" In modern usage, troglodyte may be used in three ways. It may refer specifically to a prehistoric cave dweller, as the Neanderthals (nee-AN -dur-TAWLZ) were troglodytes. In a broader sense, troglodyte may refer to anyone who lives in a primitive, degenerate, or debased manner or condition, or who is primitive, brutish, and displays a crude lack of sophistication regarding intellectual or cultural matters: ""Simone couldn't talk to her coworkers about the novels, plays, concerts, and exhibits she enjoyed because all the people she worked with were couch potatoes, soap opera junkies, mall rats, and troglodytes."" Troglodyte may also refer to a person who chooses to live in seclusion, a hermit, recluse. The billionaire Howard Hughes was a notorious—and notoriously eccentric— troglodyte.<br>Would you like two challenging synonyms for a person who lives in seclusion? Try anchorite (ANGK-uh-RYT) and eremite (ER-uh-MYT).<br><br>(1)	A cave dweller.<br>(2)	A person who lives or behaves in a primitive, brutish, or crude manner.<br>(3)	A person who lives in seclusion.<br>Corresponding adjective: troglodytic.<br>Etymology: Greek, literally ""one who creeps into holes.""<br>Additional useful words: anchorite, eremite (both mean ""a hermit, recluse, person who lives in seclusion"")."
Aleatory,[AY-lee-uh-TOR-ee],"Depending on luck, chance, or on some contingent event; hence, uncertain, unpredictable.<br>In law, an aleatory contract is an agreement whose conditions depend on a contingency, an uncertain event. An aleatory sale is one whose completion depends on the outcome of some uncertain event. Aleatory music leaves certain sounds up to the performer or up to chance.<br>Aleatory comes from the Latin aleator, a gamester, thrower of dice, crapshooter, which comes in turn from alea, a game of dice. Aleatory means literally depending upon the throw of the dice. In current usage, aleatory may mean gambling or pertaining to gambling, as Las Vegas is the mecca of aleatory activity, but the word is probably more often used to mean depending on luck or chance, uncertain, unpredictable. Aleatory investments are risky investments; an aleatory business needs good luck to succeed.<br><br>Depending on luck, chance, or on some contingent event; hence, uncertain, unpredictable.<br>Etymology: Latin aleator, a gamester, thrower of dice, crapshooter, which comes in turn from alea, a game of dice.

Farrago,[fuh-RAY-goh or fuh-RAH-goh],"A mixture, especially a confused or jumbled mixture.<br>Synonyms of farrago include conglomeration, medley, mishmash, hodgepodge, miscellany, potpourri, pastiche, and salmagundi.<br>Farrago comes from a Latin word meaning mixed fodder for animals, a jumbled assortment of grains. In modern usage, farrago may be used literally or figuratively of any mixture, especially a confused, jumbled, or miscellaneous assortment of things: ""A computer is an amazing tool for storing or sorting through a farrago of information""; ""Every day, the psychiatrist listens to an astonishing farrago of hopes, fears, dreams, wishes, doubts, and resentments.""<br>The corresponding adjective is farraginous (fuh-RAJ-i-nus), mixed, jumbled, miscellaneous, heterogeneous, as a farraginous collection of notes or ideas.<br><br>A mixture, especially a confused or jumbled mixture.<br>Synonyms: conglomeration, medley, mishmash, hodgepodge, miscellany, potpourri, pastiche, salmagundi.<br>Etymology: Latin, literally ""mixed fodder for animals; a jumbled assortment of grains.""<br>Corresponding adjective: farraginous, mixed, jumbled, miscellaneous, heterogeneous."
Cynosure,[SY-nuh-SHUUR],"A center of attention or interest, focal point.<br>Cynosure comes from the Greek kynosoura, a dog's tail, from kynos, a dog. From the corresponding Greek adjective, kynikos, we inherit the English adjective cynical, which means literally like a dog.<br>Pardon me if I digress for a moment, but the words cynical, cynic, and cynicism have an interesting history that I’d like to share with you.<br>Cynicism was a school of ancient Greek philosophy founded by Antisthenes (an-TIS-thuh-NEEZ) of Athens, a pupil of Socrates. ""The chief doctrines of the Cynics,"" says the Century Dictionary (1914), ""were that virtue is the only good, that the essence of virtue is self-control, and that pleasure is an evil if sought for its own sake. They were accordingly characterized by an ostentatious contempt [for] riches, arts, science, and amusements.""<br>The most famous exponent of Cynicism was Diogenes (dy-AH-ji-NEEZ) of Sinope (si-NOH-pee), who took cynicism to an extreme. In his disdain for human selfishness and his pursuit of a simple life, Diogenes is said to have slept in a tub, thrown away his only utensil, a cup, when he saw a peasant drinking from his hands, and wandered through the streets at midday with a lantern, telling those who asked what he was doing that he was searching for an honest man. According to the third edition of the American Heritage Dictionary (1992), Diogenes is also ""said to have performed such actions as barking in public, urinating on the leg of a table, and masturbating on the street."" Apparently as a result of this doglike behavior, Diogenes was nicknamed kynos or kyon, meaning ""a dog,"" and the nickname was extended to the philosophy of Cynicism and its adherents. Today when we call people cynical, we mean they are scornful or skeptical of people's motives or that they believe human beings are motivated only by selfishness—in short, that people are dogs.<br>You will recall that our keyword, cynosure, comes from the Greek kynosoura, a dog's tail. When spelled with a capital C, cynosure refers to the constellation Ursa Minor or to Polaris, the North Star, also called the polestar, which is part of this constellation. The North Star is the outermost star in the handle of the Little Dipper, which the Greeks apparently perceived as a dog's tail.<br>Since ancient times the North Star has been used as a navigational guide.<br>Thus, cynosure first came to mean anything that guides or directs, and then came to mean anything or anyone that is the center of attention or interest, a focal point: ""He was the cynosure of the party""; ""This issue is the cynosure of the campaign.""<br><br>A center of attention or interest, focal point.<br>Etymology: Greek kynosoura, a dog's tail, from kynos, a dog.<br>N.B. This discussion explores the origin of the words cynical, cynic, and cynicism, and their relation to Diogenes of Sinope, a Cynic philosopher nicknamed kynos, or kyon, ""the dog,"" for his outrageous behavior.<br>Usage: Cynosure (capital C) refers to the constellation Ursa Minor or to Polaris, the North Star, also called the polestar, which is part of this constellation."
Badinage,[BAD-i-NAHZH or BAD-i-NAHZH],"Banter; playful, teasing talk; good-natured joking or gently mocking conversation.<br>Synonyms of badinage include repartee (REP-ur-TEE), raillery (RAYL-ur-ree), and persiflage (PUR-si-FLAHZH).<br>The words banter, badinage, persiflage, and raillery all suggest ""good-humored jesting,"" says Webster's New International Dictionary, second edition (1934). Banter implies light, playful mocking or ridicule; badinage suggests ""more trifling and delicate"" teasing or jesting; persiflage refers to ""frivolous or flippant"" talk or writing; and raillery implies playful mockery that is ""keener and often more sarcastic.""<br>Banter; playful, teasing talk; good-natured joking or gently mocking conversation.<br>Synonyms: repartee, raillery, persiflage.<br>N.B.

Hieratic,[HY-uh-RAT-ik],"Priestly; pertaining to or used by priests; reserved for holy or sacred uses.<br>Synonyms of hieratic include clerical, ministerial, pastoral (PAS-tur-ul), ecclesiastical, and sacerdotal (SAS-ur-DOH-tul).<br>The prefix hiero-, often shortened to hier-, comes from Greek and means sacred, holy, divine. This prefix appears in several interesting English words. Hierocracy (HY-uh-RAHK-ruh-see) means rule by priests, ecclesiastical government. Hierarch (HY-ur-AHRK) means a person who rules over sacred things, a high priest, and also a person who occupies a high position in a hierarchy. Hierarchy (HY-ur-AHRK-ee) may denote religious rule or the organization of a religious order into ranks and grades, as the Roman Catholic hierarchy, but today hierarchy commonly refers to any organized body or system strictly arranged in order of rank, power, or class.<br>Hieratic means pertaining to priests or to the priesthood, as hieratic vestments or hieratic rituals. Hieratic may also designate a form of ancient Egyptian writing in which the traditional hieroglyphics took on a more cursive, or flowing, form.

From the same source comes democracy, which means literally rule by the people, popular government. The words demotic and vernacular are synonymous. In ancient Egypt, the demotic style of writing was used by the people, the laity; the hieratic style was used by the priesthood.

Vitiate,[VISH-ee-AYT],"To corrupt, spoil, ruin, contaminate, impair the quality of, make faulty or impure; also, to weaken morally, defile, debase.<br>Vitiate comes from the Latin vitium, a fault, vice.

Venial,[VEE-nee-ul],"Excusable, forgivable, pardonable, able to be overlooked.<br>Venial comes from the Latin venia, grace, indulgence, and means excusable, forgivable, minor or trivial enough to be overlooked. A venial offense can be pardoned; a venial error can be overlooked; a venial insult can be forgiven; and venial negligence can be excused.<br>In theology, venial is opposed to mortal.

Contretemps,[KAHN-truh-TAH(N)],"An embarrassing, awkward, unexpected situation or event; a sudden mishap or hitch; an inopportune occurrence.<br>In colloquial terms, a contretemps is something that happens in the wrong place at the wrong time, which leaves you high and dry: ""There was a contretemps at the party last night when John got soused and started yelling at his wife."" ""The company can survive a contretemps, but it must avoid a scandal at all costs.""<br>Contretemps comes from French and by derivation means something ""against the time"" or ""out of time""; hence, something unexpected or inopportune. The Oxford English Dictionary shows that when the word entered English in the late seventeenth century it applied to the sport of fencing and meant ""a pass or thrust…made at a wrong or inopportune moment."" That meaning disappeared by the eighteenth century, and since then contretemps has meant something unexpected that occurs at an inopportune moment and creates an awkward or embarrassing situation.<br>Because it is an unusual word, not often used in conversation, its pronunciation has never been fully anglicized—that is, made to conform to English ways. Current dictionaries generally prefer the half-anglicized KAHN-truh-TAH(N). The plural is spelled the same but pronounced KAHN -truh-TAH(N)Z.<br>Contretemps may vary in severity, but they are never on the same scale as a scandal or a crisis. Contretemps are the common stuff of newspaper stories, for they occur frequently in politics and business. Sitcoms and romantic comedies also rely on contretemps to generate laughs and move the plot. The workplace usually is good for one or two juicy contretemps a month, and if you like to socialize or get together with members of your family, then chances are you already are intimately acquainted with that utterly unexpected, embarrassing, and awkward situation known as the contretemps.<br><br>An embarrassing, awkward, unexpected situation or event; a sudden mishap or hitch; an inopportune occurrence.<br>Etymology: French, literally ""against the time"" or ""out of time""; first applied in English to the sport of fencing to mean (OED) ""a pass or thrust ... made at a wrong or inopportune moment.""<br>Usage and pronunciation tip: The plural is spelled the same, contretemps, but pronounced KAHN-truh-tah(n)z."

Sanguine,[SANG-gwin],"Confident, cheerful, hopeful, optimistic.<br>As you may recall from the discussion of phlegmatic (word 33 of Level 9), in ancient physiology there were four humors, or bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, choler (also called yellow bile), and melancholy (also called black bile). Early physicians believed that a person's health and disposition were determined by the relative proportions of these humors.<br>Sanguine originally meant having blood as the dominant humor in one's system; hence, having a ruddy, healthy complexion and a warm temperament. Eventually this sense evolved into the current meaning: confident, cheerfully optimistic.<br>Sanguine and sanguinary (SANG-gwi-NER-ee) are sometimes confused because of their common derivation, the Latin sanguis, blood. Sanguinary means either bloody, accompanied by bloodshed and slaughter, or bloodthirsty, eager for bloodshed. Sanguine either means blood-colored, ruddy, red, as a sanguine complexion, or, more often, filled with the uplifting humor of blood, and therefore confident, cheerful, optimistic.<br><br>Confident, cheerful, hopeful, optimistic.<br>Etymology: (Latin sanguis, blood) Sanguine originally meant having blood as the dominant humor in one's system; hence, having a ruddy, healthy complexion and a warm temperament.

Deipnosophist,[dyp-NAHS-uh-fist],"An adept conversationalist, especially one who enjoys conversing at the table.<br>You'll need to check a hefty unabridged dictionary to find the unusual words deipnosophist, deipnosophistic (dyp-NAHS-uh-FIS-tik), and deipnosophism (dyp-NAHS-uh-FIZ-'m), which come from the Greek deipnon, a meal, and sophistes, a wise man. Like the word symposium (sim-POH-zee-um), which means literally a drinking party, and comes from the title of a Platonic dialogue, deipnosophist comes from the Deipnosophistai of the Greek writer Athenaeus (ATH-uh-NEE-us), in which he details the conversation of a group of learned men who are dining together. For your next symposium, whether you plan to cook a gourmet meal or have a potluck, try inviting a few deipnosophists to liven up the conversation.<br>I have known many deipnosophists, I am something of one myself, and in my book they fall into three categories: the preprandial (pree-PRAN-dee-ul) deipnosophists, who excel at conversation over cocktails before dinner; the postprandial (pohst-PRAN-dee-ul) deipnosophists, who hit their stride and wax eloquent after the plates have been cleared away; and the vulgar deipnosophists, who talk incessantly through the meal, usually with their mouths full.<br><br>An adept conversationalist, especially one who enjoys conversing at the table.<br>Etymology and related words: Deipnosophist (noun), deipnosophistic (adjective), and deipnosophism (noun) come from the Greek deipnon, a meal, and sophistes, a wise man. The Deipnosophistai by Athenaeus details the conversation of a group of learned men who are dining together.<br>Additional useful words: Symposium, which means literally ""a drinking party,"" comes from the title of a Platonic dialogue; preprandial, before dinner; postprandial, after dinner."
Frangible,[FRAN-ji-buul],"Breakable, fragile, frail, delicate, easily damaged or destroyed.<br>Fragile applies to something so delicately constructed that it is easily broken. Frangible adds to this the idea of a susceptibility to being broken, even if the object in question is not inherently delicate. The solid steel of a car is frangible if struck by another car. The heart of a brave and sanguine person might be frangible in an especially sad and poignant situation. The unusual word friable (FRY-uh-buul) means easily crumbled, crushed, or pulverized. Dried herbs are friable, as are the stiff, yellowed pages of an old book.<br><br>Breakable, fragile, frail, delicate, easily damaged or destroyed.<br>Additional useful word: friable, easily crumbled, crushed, or pulverized."
Apodictic,[AP-uh-DIK-tik],"Absolutely certain, necessarily true, proved or demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br>Synonyms of apodictic include incontestable, incontrovertible, and irrefragable (i-REF-ruh-guh-buul).<br>Apodictic is chiefly a technical term used in logic of a judgment that asserts its own necessity. ""Such judgments,"" cautions the Century Dictionary, ""may be false."" Apodictic is a lovely word, so much more forceful and decisive than certain or true, yet I wonder what in life honestly can be called apodictic, absolutely certain, necessarily true. Can you think of anything that is unarguably apodictic? Perhaps only death and taxes.<br><br>Absolutely certain, necessarily true, proved or demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br>Synonyms: incontestable, incontrovertible, irrefragable."
Fulminate,[FUHL-mi-NAYT or FUUL-mi-NAYT],"To explode, especially to explode with invective and denunciations; to shout forth condemnation and censure.<br>The verb to fulminate and the corresponding noun fulmination come through the Latin fulminare, to strike with lightning, from fulmen, a stroke of lightning, thunderbolt. Fulminate was once used to mean to strike with lightning, but this sense is obsolete and in modern usage fulminate suggests the throwing of verbal thunderbolts, and fulmination suggests a thundering verbal explosion: ""The speaker fulminated against corruption and vice""; ""The dispute between the two nations has not reached the point of war, but there have been fulminations from both sides."" <br>To explode, especially to explode with invective and denunciations; to shout forth condemnation and censure.<br>Corresponding noun: fulmination, an explosion, detonation; also (especially) a thundering verbal explosion, loud denunciation or condemnation.<br>Etymology: Latin fulminare, to strike with lightning, from fulmen, a stroke of lightning, thunderbolt."
Scarify,[SKAR-i-fy],"To wound the feelings of; make cutting remarks about; distress by criticizing sharply.<br>Synonyms of scarify include lacerate (word 35 of Level 1), flay, castigate, vituperate, and excoriate (word 40 of Level 9). The corresponding noun is scarification.<br>The verbs to scarify and scare are similar in spelling and sound but they are entirely unrelated in derivation and meaning.<br>Scarify comes through Latin and Greek words meaning to scratch, ultimately from the Greek skariphos, a pencil or stylus. In modern usage, scarify has three senses, the first two literal and the third figurative. Scarify is used in medicine to mean to make a series of shallow cuts or punctures in the skin; certain vaccinations are administered by scarification. Scarify is also used in agriculture to mean to cut into the ground, loosen or break up the soil either to aerate it or in preparation for planting. Out of these literal senses, which suggest scratching and scraping, scarify came to be used figuratively to mean to scratch with words; hence, to wound the feelings of, make cutting remarks about, distress by criticizing sharply.<br><br>(1)	To wound the feelings of; make cutting remarks about; distress by criticizing sharply.<br>(2)	(medicine) To make a series of shallow cuts or punctures in the skin, as in vaccinating.<br>(3)	(agriculture) To cut into the ground; loosen or break up the soil either to aerate it or in preparation for planting.<br>Synonyms: lacerate (Level 1, Word 35), flay, castigate, vituperate, excoriate (Level 9, Word 40).<br>Corresponding noun: scarification.<br>Etymology: Literally, ""to scratch,"" from Greek skariphos, a pencil or stylus.<br>Usage: Scarify and scare are similar in spelling and sound but entirely unrelated in derivation and meaning."
Hebdomadal,[heb-DAHM-uh-dul],"Weekly; pertaining to a week or seven-day period.<br>The adjective hebdomadal, and the corresponding noun hebdomad ( HEB-duh-MAD) come from the Latin and Greek words for the number seven. The noun hebdomad may mean a group of seven; for example, a seven-member commission or board is a hebdomad. Hebdomad may also mean a seven-day period, a week. The adjective hebdomadal means weekly: hebdomadal duties are weekly duties; a hebdomadal occasion is an occasion that occurs once a week.<br><br>Weekly; pertaining to a week or seven-day period.<br>Corresponding noun: hebdomad, a group of seven or a seven-day period, a week.<br>Etymology: Latin and Greek words for the number 7."
Divagate,[DY-vuh-GAYT],"To wander, ramble, or drift about; hence, to digress.<br>The verb to divagate and the corresponding noun divagation (DY-vuhGAY-shin) come from the Latin divagari, to wander about, which comes in turn from dis-, meaning ""apart,"" and vagari, to wander, ramble, roam. In modern usage, divagate is a grandiloquent synonym for wander or digress, and divagation is a loftier word for a digression or the act of wandering or rambling. You may divagate literally, as to spend a summer divagating across the country. Or you may divagate figuratively: ""Leroy dreaded his eighty-year-old mother's hebdomadal phone call, because she would jabber and scold and divagate for an hour."" <br>To wander, ramble, or drift about hence, to digress.<br>Corresponding noun: divagation, a digression or the act of wandering or rambling.<br>Etymology: Latin divagari, to wander about, from dis-, ""apart,"" and vagari, to wander, ramble, roam."
Iatrogenic,[eye-A-truh-JEN-ik],"Caused by medical examination or treatment.<br>Pathological, which means pertaining to or caused by disease, is the antonym of iatrogenic.<br>The word iatric (eye-A-trik) means pertaining to medicine or medical doctors. The combining form iatro- comes from the Greek iatros, a physician; in English iatro- means ""medical"" or ""medicine."" The combining form -genic means ""producing"" or ""generating."" By derivation, that which is iatrogenic is produced by a medical doctor or generated by medical treatment.<br>Iatrogenic is used of ailments, maladies, or symptoms caused by medical treatment, especially one caused by a drug or surgery. An iatrogenic disorder may be cause for a malpractice suit against the doctor whose treatment induced it.<br><br>Caused by medical examination or treatment.<br>Antonym: pathological, pertaining to or caused by disease.<br>Etymology and related word: Iatric, pertaining to medicine or medical doctors, and iatrogenic begin with the combining form iatro- (Greek iatros, a physician), which means ""medical"" or ""medicine.""

Tergiversation,[TUR-ji-vur-SAY-shin],"Desertion; specifically, the act of deserting something to which one was previously loyal, such as a cause, a party, or a religious faith.<br>Synonyms of tergiversation include abandonment and defection.<br>The noun tergiversation and the corresponding verb tergiversate (TUR -ji-vur-SAYT) come from a Latin word meaning ""to turn one's back."" When you tergiversate, you turn your back on something to which you were previously loyal and become a deserter or a renegade. When tergiversate denotes the desertion of a religious faith or creed, it is synonymous with apostatize (uh-PAHS-tuh-TYZ). Tergiversation means the act of desertion, and the word usually applies to the abandonment of a cause, a party, or a religion.<br>These words may also be used figuratively of language that is shifty and evasive, that does not take a firm stand. In this sense, tergiversate is a synonym of equivocate, which means to speak in a subtle and evasive manner; and the noun tergiversation is a synonym of equivocation, which means a shifty or evasive statement, language that does not come straight to the point or take a firm stand.<br>Desertion; specifically, the act of deserting something to which one was previously loyal, such as a cause, a party, or a religious faith.<br>Synonyms: abandonment, defection.<br>Corresponding verb: tergiversate (TUR-jiv-ursayt). Tergiversate and Apostatize are synonmous.<br>Etymology: Latin, literally ""to turn one's back.""<br>Usage: Tergiversate and tergiversation may also be used figuratively of language that is shifty and evasive, that does not take a firm stand. In this sense, tergiversate is a synonym of equivocate and tergiversation is a synonym of equivocation."
Nacreous,[NAY-kree-us],"Pearly, consisting of or resembling mother-of-pearl.<br>Synonyms of nacreous include iridescent (IR-i-DES-int), which means having or displaying lustrous, rainbowlike colors, and the unusual word margaritaceous (MAHR-guh-ri-TAY-shus).<br>Random House Webster's College Dictionary (1999) defines mother-of-pearl as ""a hard, iridescent substance that forms the inner layer of certain mollusk shells, used for making buttons, beads, etc."" Mother-of-pearl also goes by the name nacre (NAY-kur). The adjective corresponding to the noun nacre is nacreous, pearly, made of or resembling mother-of-pearl.<br><br>Pearly, consisting of or resembling mother-ofpearl.<br>Synonyms: iridescent, margaritaceous.<br>Corresponding noun: nacre (NAY-kur), a synonym of mother-of-pearl."
Faineant,[FAY-nee-int],"Lazy, idle, sluggish, good-for-nothing: ""When her thirty-year-old son refused to get a job and demanded more money as an allowance, Mrs. Jones decided that enough was enough and it was time to kick her faineant offspring out of the house.""<br>Common synonyms of faineant include do-nothing, shiftless, slothful, and lackadaisical, which is often mispronounced LAKS-adaisical. There is no lax in lackadaisical (LAK-uh-DAY-zi-kuul).<br>More challenging synonyms of faineant include lethargic, indolent, somnolent, torpid, otiose (OH-shee-OHS), and also hebetudinous (HEB-uh-T(Y)OO-di-nus), the adjective corresponding to the noun hebetude (HEB-i-T(Y)OOD), word 20 of this level.<br>Faineant comes from a French phrase meaning ""to do nothing."" Faineant may be used as an adjective to mean lazy, good-for-nothing, or as a noun to mean a lazy person, an idler, sluggard. The corresponding noun is faineance (FAY-nee-ints). Faineance means idleness, inactivity, indolence, or the lazy, do-nothing attitude of a faineant person.<br>If you look up faineant in a current dictionary, you may find it spelled with an accent, fainéant, and find the French pronunciation, fay-nay-AH(N), listed first or even listed alone. Frankly, I find that perplexing, because two of the twentieth-century's most respected arbiters on pronunciation, the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, published in 1934, and Kenyon and Knott's Pronouncing Dictionary of American English, published in 1949, both prefer the pronunciation FAY-nee-int.<br>Faineant entered English in the early 1600s. After nearly four hundred years, it's expected and sensible to anglicize a word, make it conform to English custom. And when an anglicized pronunciation has existed in educated speech for a half-century or more, it doesn't make sense to retain or revive the foreign pronunciation. It's one thing to use a twenty-dollar word in conversation; it's quite another thing to use it with a pretentious (and especially a Frenchified) pronunciation. Faineant and faineance have earned their place in the language and they cry out for full anglicization. It's high time we spelled them without an accent and pronounced them as assimilated English words.<br><br>Lazy, idle, sluggish, good-for-nothing.<br>Synonyms: do-nothing, shiftless, slothful,, lackadaisical, lethargic, indolent, somnolent, torpid, otiose, hebetudinous.<br>Pronunciation tip: There is no lax in lackadaisical; say LAK-uh-DAY-zuh-kul.<br>Etymology: French, literally ""to do nothing.""<br>Corresponding nouns: faineant, a lazy person, an idler, sluggard; faineance, idleness, inactivity, indolence, or the lazy, do-nothing attitude of a faineant person.<br>Pronunciation tip: If you look up faineant in a current dictionary, you may find the French pronunciation, fay-nay-A(N), listed first or even listed alone. Despite what these sources say, the French pronunciation is not recommended because evidence shows that educated speakers have anglicized the word (made it sound English) since at least the 1920s. Two of the 20thcentury's most respected arbiters on pronunciation, the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary (1934), and Kenyon and Knott's Pronouncing Dictionary of American English (1949), both prefer FAY-nee-int."
Hispid,[HIS-pid],"Covered with stiff hairs, bristles, or small spines; rough and bristly.<br>Hispid and hirsute (HUR-s(y)oot) are close in meaning.<br>Hispid comes from the Latin hispidus, rough, hairy, bristly. Although the Oxford English Dictionary contains one figurative citation that refers to ""a hispid law,"" hispid is used chiefly in a literal sense of leaves, plants, insects, animals, and occasionally human beings and inanimate objects to mean covered with rough, stiff hairs or bristles. The nettle, with its small, stinging spines, is a hispid plant; although the spines of the porcupine are relatively large, the animal can fairly be described as hispid.<br>Hirsute comes from the Latin hirsutus, covered with hair, rough, shaggy. In botany and zoology, hirsute and hispid are synonymous. In general usage, however, hirsute means extremely hairy or covered with hair: ""Abigail told Angela that she did not care for hirsute men.""<br><br>Covered with stiff hairs, bristles, or small spines; rough and bristly.<br>Etymology: Latin hispidus, rough, hairy, bristly.<br>N.B. This discussion distinguishes hispid and hirsute, which means extremely hairy or covered with hair."
Longanimity,[LAHNG-guh-NIM-i-tee],"Long-suffering patience; the ability to calmly endure hardship or suffering.<br>Longanimity and forbearance are synonyms.<br>Longanimity comes ultimately from the Latin longus, meaning ""long,"" and animus, spirit, mind. By derivation, a person who displays longanimity has the strength of spirit and mind to endure hardship or suffering for a long, long time.<br><br>Long-suffering patience; the ability to calmly endure hardship or suffering.<br>Synonym: forbearance.<br>Etymology: Latin longus, meaning ""long,"" and animus, spirit, mind."
Sciolist,[SY-uh-list],"A person who has only superficial knowledge of a subject, or who pretends to have knowledge.<br>Sciolist and the corresponding noun sciolism (SY-uh-liz-'m) come through a Latin word meaning ""a smatterer,"" and ultimately from the Latin scire, to know. By derivation, and in modern usage, a sciolist is a person who has only a smattering of knowledge, and sciolism means superficial or pretended knowledge.<br>Sciolist may also apply to people who pretend to be more knowledgeable or learned than they are, or who make a pretentious display of what little they know. As the saying goes, ""A little learning is a dangerous thing."" The sciolist is a person you want to either avoid or watch carefully, because a small mind containing only a smattering of knowledge is likely to think mean, small-minded thoughts.<br><br>A person who has only superficial knowledge of a subject, or who pretends to have knowledge.<br>Etymology: Latin, literally ""a smatterer,"" ultimately from the Latin scire, to know.<br>Corresponding noun: sciolism, superficial or pretended knowledge."
Propinquity,[proh- or pruh-PING-kwi-tee],"Nearness in place or time, proximity (word 50 of Level 1); also, nearness or similarity in nature, kinship, close relation.<br>In Latin, propinquitas means either nearness, proximity, or friendship, relationship. From this Latin word comes the English adjective propinquity, which is used to mean either nearness in place or time, or nearness of blood or nature.<br>According to the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary (1934), proximity ""denotes simple nearness,"" as the proximity of their houses, or living in proximity to downtown. Propinquity ""connotes close neighborhood"" and ""personal vicinity,"" as the propinquity of marriage, the propinquity of brothers and sisters, the propinquity of vice on the mean streets of the big city, or the hebdomadal propinquity of Christmas and New Year's Day. (Remember hebdomadal, word 27 of this level? It means weekly or pertaining to a week.)<br><br>(1)	Nearness in place or time, proximity.<br>(2)	Nearness or similarity in nature, kinship, close relation.<br>Etymology: Latin propinquitas, nearness, proximity, or friendship, relationship.

Factitious,[fak-TISH-us],"Not natural or genuine, produced artificially.<br>Synonyms of factitious include sham, contrived, bogus, fraudulent, and spurious (word 18 of Level 8).<br>Factitious comes through the Latin facticius, made by art, artificial, from the verb facere, to make. A factitious word is not genuine; it has been made up. A factitious need is artificially produced. A factitious smile is unnatural and manufactured for the occasion. And when something has factitious value, its value is not genuine or intrinsic but has been artificially created or imposed.<br>According to the Century Dictionary (1914), ""an artificial or factitious demand in the market is one that is manufactured, the [factitious demand] being the more laboriously worked up; a factitious demand exists only in the invention of one and the imagination of another.""<br><br>Not natural or genuine, produced artificially.<br>Synonyms: sham, contrived, bogus, fraudulent, spurious (Level 8, Word 18).<br>Etymology: Latin facticius, made by art, artificial, from facere, to make.

Plexiform,[PLEK-si-FORM],"In general, complicated or elaborate; specifically, like a plexus or network.<br>According to Random House Webster's College Dictionary (1999), the noun plexus (PLEK-sus) means ""a network"" or ""any complex structure containing an intricate network of parts,"" as ""the plexus of international relations."" In medicine, plexus is used to describe various networks of nerves and blood vessels.<br>Plexus comes from the Latin plectere, to braid, intertwine, interweave. The adjective plexiform combines plexus and the suffix -form to mean formed like a plexus or network. Plexiform may be used in this sense, as the plexiform nature of computer bulletin boards and online services.<br>However, outside the fields of medicine and science, plexiform probably is more often used in a more general sense to mean having the qualities of a complex network, and therefore extremely complicated or elaborate. We speak of the plexiform nature of human relationships; a plexiform bureaucracy; plexiform negotiations; the plexiform operations of a multinational corporation; or the plexiform financial structure of Wall Street.<br><br>In general, complicated or elaborate; specifically, like a plexus or network.<br>Related word: plexus, ""a network"" or ""any complex structure containing an intricate network of parts"" (Random House Webster's College Dictionary).<br>Etymology: Latin plectere, to braid, intertwine, interweave."
Susurrus,[suu-SUR-us],"A soft, subdued sound; a whispering, murmuring, muttering, or rustling sound.<br>A susurrus and a susurration (SOO-suh-RAY-shin) are the same thing. The corresponding verb is susurrate (suu-SUR-ayt), to whisper, murmur; and the adjective is susurrant (suu-SUR-ant), softly whispering, rustling, or murmuring. All of these soft-sounding words come from the Latin susurrare , to whisper, murmer, mutter.<br>A susurrus or a susurration—pick the soft-sounding word you prefer— can apply to many things, because so many things create a whispering, murmuring, muttering, or rustling sound.

Triturate,[TRICH-uh-RAYT],"To grind, crush, or pound into fine particles or powder.<br>Synonyms of triturate include pulverize, comminute (KAHM-i-N(Y)OOT), and levigate (LEV-i-GAYT).<br>To pulverize and to triturate are virtually interchangeable; both words suggest reducing something to fine particles or powder. Pulverize comes from the Latin pulvis, dust, and by derivation suggests reducing something to dust. Triturate comes from a Latin word meaning to thresh grain or tread out corn, and by derivation suggests a violent beating, bruising, pounding, crushing, rubbing, or grinding action. When used figuratively, pulverize is the more violent word, and means to destroy or demolish completely, as to pulverize an opponent. Used figuratively, triturate suggests either a grinding or crushing into small pieces or a wearing down to nothing by friction: ""Her job was triturating all her creative abilities""; ""He triturated his financial assets until he was bankrupt.""<br>The corresponding noun is trituration (TRICH-uh-RAY-shin).<br>To grind, crush, or pound into fine particles or powder.<br>Synonyms: pulverize, comminute, levigate.<br>Etymology: Latin, ""to thresh grain"" or ""tread out corn.""<br>N.B.

Protean,[PROH-tee-in],"Highly variable or changeable; readily assuming different shapes, forms, characters, or meanings.<br>The adjective protean is an eponymous word, a word derived from a name. It comes from Proteus (PROH-tee-us), the name of a sea god in ancient Greek mythology who could change his shape at will. That which is protean is changeable like Proteus, able to quickly take on different shapes, forms, characters, or meanings. A master of disguise is protean, taking on the appearance of different characters; words can sometimes be protean, taking on different meanings; dreams are often protean, assuming different forms; a person's career can be protean, full of changes; and in my house at least, leftovers are decidedly protean, readily assuming different shapes or forms.<br><br>Highly variable or changeable; readily assuming different shapes, forms, characters, or meanings.<br>Etymology: Proteus, a sea god in ancient Greek mythology who could change his shape at will."
Crepitate,[KREP-i-TAYT],"To crackle; make a crackling, snapping, or popping noise.<br>The verb to crepitate comes from the Latin crepitare, to crackle, creak, rattle, or clatter. From the same source we inherit the word decrepit (di-KREP-it), which by derivation means having bones that creak and rattle from old age, and also the unusual word crepitaculum (KREP-i-TAK -yuh-lum), the rattle or rattling organ of the rattlesnake.<br>To crepitate means to do what the ads tell us the cereal does: snap, crackle, and pop. The corresponding adjective is crepitant (KREP-i-tint), crackling or creaking, as the crepitant stairs of an old house. The corresponding noun is crepitation (KREP-i-TAY-shin), as the crepitations of firecrackers on the Fourth of July. In medicine, a crepitation is the grating sound or sensation produced by rubbing together the fractured ends of a broken bone.<br>Ouch!

Noctivagant,[nahk-TIV-uh-gint],"Wandering at night.<br>Noctivagant comes from the Latin noctivagus, wandering by night, which comes in turn from nox, meaning ""night,"" and vagari, to wander about. This Latin vagari is also the source of the English adjective vague, literally ""wandering in thought,"" vagabond, a wanderer, and vagary (traditionally vuh-GAIR-ee, now usually VAY-guh-ree). A vagary is an odd, whimsical idea or an unpredictable, capricious action or event, as the vagaries of the stock market.<br>Our keyword, the adjective noctivagant, means wandering in the night.

Fuliginous,[fyoo-LIJ-i-nus],"Sooty, smoky; pertaining to, resembling, or consisting of soot or smoke.<br>Fuliginous comes from the Latin fuligo, soot. The word entered English in the 1600s and since then has been used both literally to mean sooty or smoky and figuratively to mean dark, dusky, or obscure. Fuliginous air is filled with soot or smog. When you clean the windows of your car, you wash off the fuliginous grime. A fuliginous bar is a dark and smoky bar. Fuliginous ideas or thoughts are darkened as if by soot, and therefore are muddled and obscure.<br><br>Sooty, smoky; pertaining to, resembling, or consisting of soot or smoke.<br>Etymology: Latin fuligo, soot."

Heliolatry,[HEE-lee-AHL-uh-tree],"Worship of the sun.<br>The combining form helio- comes from the Greek helios, the sun, and is used in English words to mean the sun. For example, heliotherapy (HEE-lee-oh-THER-uh-pee) is a form of medical treatment involving exposure to sunlight. In astronomy, heliocentric (hee-lee-oh-sen-trik) means regarding the sun as the center of our planetary system, as opposed to geocentric (jee-oh-sen-trik), which refers to the pre-Copernican notion that the Sun revolves around the earth.<br>The fascinating word heliotropism (hee-lee-ah-truh-piz'm) is formed from helio-, the sun, and the greek tropos, a turning. heliotropism refers to the tendency of plants to bend or move toward—or in some cases, away from —a source of light.<br>Our keyword, heliolatry, combines helio-, the sun, with the Greek latreia, meaning ""worship."" the corresponding noun is heliolater (hee-lee-ahl-uh-tur), a sun worshiper, and the corresponding adjective is heliolatrous (hee-lee-ahl-uh-trus), sun-worshiping.<br><br>Worship of the sun.<br>Etymology and related words: Greek helios, the sun, and latreia, worship.

Sciamachy,[sy-AM-uh-kee],"Shadow-boxing; the act of fighting a shadow or an imaginary enemy.<br>Sciamachy comes from the Greek skia, a shadow, and mache, a battle, contest, struggle. This Greek mache is the source of the English combining form -machy, which, when tacked on to a word, denotes a battle, contest, or struggle. Theomachy (thee-AHM-uh-kee) is a battle against or between gods; gigantomachy (JY-gan-TAHM-uh-kee) is a war or battle between giants or superhuman beings; logomachy (luh-GAHM-uh-kee), from the Greek logos, meaning ""word,"" is a battle of words; and our keyword, sciamachy, is a battle with a shadow, a contest with an imaginary enemy.<br><br>Shadow-boxing; the act of fighting a shadow or an imaginary enemy.<br>Etymology and related words: Greek skia, a shadow, and mache, a battle, contest, struggle.

Glabrous,[GLAB-rus],"Smooth and bald.<br>Glabrous comes from the Latin glaber, without hair, bald, and is used chiefly in biology of something that has a smooth surface without hair, down, fuzz, or other projections. In my humble opinion, a refined word meaning ""smooth and bald"" has the potential for many applications outside the realm of science. I offer two examples to point you in the right direction: ""The amazing Michael Jordan's glabrous head,"" and ""The glabrous bodies of maidens in bikinis practicing heliolatry on the beach.""<br><br>Smooth and bald.<br>Etymology: Latin glaber, without hair, bald."
Pettifogger,[PET-ee-FAHG-ur],"A mean, tricky lawyer; especially, a lawyer who handles petty cases in an unethical, unscrupulous way.<br>Pettifogger is synonymous with the more familiar word shyster (SHYS-tur). The proverbial ambulance-chaser is also a breed of pettifogger.<br>The corresponding verb to pettifog (PET-ee-FAHG) means to carry on a law practice in a petty, tricky, unscrupulous way; by extension, it has also come to mean to engage in chicanery (shi-KAY-nur-ee) or unethical practices in a business of any sort. The noun pettifoggery means the unethical, unscrupulous practices of a pettifogger, legal tricks or chicanery.<br><br>A mean, tricky lawyer; especially, a lawyer who handles petty cases in an unethical, unscrupulous way.

Epicene,[EP-i-SEEN],"Having characteristics or qualities of both sexes.<br>Epicene comes through Middle English and Latin from a Greek word meaning ""in common."" By derivation, that which is epicene has characteristics in common with both sexes. Many paintings and sculptures, both classical and modern, depict epicene figures.<br>Because something that displays characteristics of both sexes is, by all rights, not a member of one sex or the other, epicene has come to mean not having the characteristics or qualities of either sex, sexless, neuter, as an epicene hairstyle or epicene clothing. And because something sexless lacks sex appeal, epicene is also sometimes used disparagingly of style to mean lacking appeal or potency, feeble, flaccid, as an epicene novel or epicene architecture. Finally, when applied to a man—or at least to someone presumed to be a man biologically—epicene is always used disparagingly to mean not virile, effeminate.<br>Hermaphroditic and epicene both suggest having characteristics of both sexes, but in different ways.<br>Hermaphroditic (hur-MAF-ruh-DIT-ik) is the adjective corresponding to the noun hermaphrodite (hur-MAF-ruh-dyt). Hermaphrodite is an eponymous word; it comes from the name Hermaphroditus (hur-MAF-ruhDY-tus). In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes (HUR-meez), the messenger of the gods, and Aphrodite (AF-ruh-DY-tee), the goddess of love and beauty. While bathing one day, Hermaphroditus was the victim of a contretemps that united him in one body with a water nymph named Salmacis (SAL-muh-sis). In modern usage, a hermaphrodite is a person who has the reproductive organs of both sexes.<br>Epicene does not usually suggest having both male and female reproductive organs but rather having a range of characteristics of both sexes, emotional as well as physical. Epicene may also be used as a noun to mean an epicene person, someone who has characteristics or qualities of both sexes.<br>(1)	Having characteristics or qualities of both sexes.<br>(2)	Not having the characteristics or qualities of either sex, sexless, neuter.<br>(3)	(of style) lacking appeal or potency, feeble, flaccid.<br>(4)	(of a man) not virile, effeminate.<br>Etymology: Greek, literally ""in common.""<br>Related words: hermaphroditic (adjective) and hermaphrodite (noun), which come from Hermaphroditus, in Greek mythology the son of Hermes, the messenger of the gods, and Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.
