Pronunciation tip: The traditional pronunciation of covert is KUH-vurt (like cover with a t at the end). Until the 1960s, KUH-vurt was the only pronunciation recognized by dictionaries. Since then the variant KOH-vurt has become so popular that several dictionaries now list it first. Dictionaries still list KUH-vurt and many older educated speakers prefer it out of respect for the word's tradition, which dates back to the 14th century. Another popular variant, koh-VURT, is often not listed at all (and is best avoided).
Those who preferto say KOH-vurt are not wrong; that pronunciation is now fully standard (meaning ""acceptable""). On the other hand, if you are not afraid to distinguish yourself as a cultivated speaker at the risk of raising a few eyebrows, then consider using the traditional pronunciation, KUH-vurt.","
